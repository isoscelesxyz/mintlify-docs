# Velodrome Documentation Gap Analysis

This document identifies substantive gaps between the current Aerodrome documentation and what would be needed for a Velodrome documentation site. It excludes trivial changes like token names (AERO→VELO), chain names (Base→Optimism), and branding.

## Executive Summary

| Category | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Shared content (copy with terminology changes) | ~70% |
| Velodrome-only content (integrate into existing pages) | ~15% |
| Aerodrome-only content (remove or replace) | ~15% |

### Integration Philosophy

Rather than creating a separate "Superchain" section (which would silo content and feel disconnected), multi-chain features should be **integrated into existing pages** at the point where users need them. This maintains the task-oriented structure and keeps documentation at a consistent level of depth.

**Approach:**
- Add sections to existing pages (vote.mdx, rewards.mdx, incentives.mdx)
- One new page for genuinely new features (Superswaps)
- FAQ entries for edge cases and common questions
- Minimal new navigation—users discover multi-chain naturally

---

## User Documentation: Integration Approach

### vote.mdx — Add Multi-Chain Voting Section

The existing vote page covers single-chain voting. For Velodrome, add a section after the basic voting steps.

**New section: "Voting for pools on other chains"**

```mdx
## Voting for pools on other chains

Your veVELO on Optimism can direct emissions to pools on any Superchain network—Mode, Lisk, Fraxtal, and more.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a chain">
    Use the chain filter on the Vote page to view pools on other networks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve WETH for cross-chain gas">
    The first time you vote cross-chain, approve WETH to cover messaging costs
    (typically 0.001-0.01 WETH per vote).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Vote as normal">
    Select pools and allocate your voting power. Votes propagate to other
    chains within ~5-10 minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  You can vote for pools on multiple chains in the same epoch. Your total
  voting power is shared across all chains.
</Info>
```

**New troubleshooting accordions to add:**

```mdx
<Accordion title="Why do I need to approve WETH?">
  Cross-chain votes use Hyperlane messaging to reach other networks.
  WETH covers the gas costs for delivering your vote. This is a one-time
  approval—subsequent votes use the existing allowance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My vote isn't showing on the other chain">
  Cross-chain vote propagation takes 5-10 minutes. If your vote doesn't
  appear after 15 minutes, check that your transaction succeeded on Optimism.
</Accordion>
```

---

### rewards.mdx — Add Multi-Chain Claiming Section

The existing rewards page covers claiming on a single chain. For Velodrome, add after the basic claiming steps.

**New section: "Claiming rewards across chains"**

```mdx
## Claiming rewards across chains

When you vote for pools on multiple chains, rewards accrue on each chain
where trading occurs. You claim rewards on each chain separately.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your Dashboard">
    Rewards are grouped by chain. Note which chains have claimable amounts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to the target chain">
    In your wallet, switch to the network where you have rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim rewards">
    Use "Claim All" to collect all rewards on that chain in one transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat for other chains">
    Switch networks and claim on each chain where you have rewards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Consider gas costs before claiming. Small reward amounts on high-gas chains
  may not be worth claiming immediately—let them accumulate.
</Warning>
```

**New troubleshooting accordions to add:**

```mdx
<Accordion title="Where do my rewards accrue?">
  Trading fees accrue on the chain where trading happens. If you voted for
  a pool on Mode, fees from that pool are claimable on Mode. Incentives
  deposited by protocols are also distributed on the chain of the pool.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I claim all rewards from Optimism?">
  No. Rewards must be claimed on each chain individually. There is no
  aggregated claiming across chains.
</Accordion>
```

---

### liquidity-pools/providing-liquidity.mdx — Add Chain Context

Add a brief info block early in the page:

```mdx
<Info>
  Velodrome pools exist on multiple Superchain networks. Use the chain
  selector to choose where to provide liquidity. Consider trading volume,
  existing liquidity depth, and gas costs when selecting a chain.
</Info>
```

No other structural changes needed—the liquidity provision process is identical per-chain.

---

### New Page: superswaps.mdx

This is a genuinely new feature requiring its own page. Place at `/overview/core-features/superswaps.mdx`.

**Full page structure:**

```mdx
---
title: "Superswaps"
description: "How to swap tokens across Superchain networks with MEV protection"
---

## How Superswaps work

Superswaps let you swap tokens across different Superchain networks in a
single transaction. The swap routes through the best liquidity across all
chains, with built-in MEV protection.

**Key features:**
- Access liquidity across 10+ chains
- MEV protection via Submarine Sends
- Single transaction from your perspective

## Before you begin

- Wallet connected to any supported Superchain network
- Tokens to swap on your source chain
- Small amount of ETH for gas on the source chain

## How to Superswap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Superswaps">
    Go to the Superswaps page on Velodrome.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select tokens">
    Choose your input token and the output token you want. Tokens can be
    on different chains.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the route">
    The UI shows which chains your swap routes through and the expected
    output amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm and swap">
    Approve the transaction. The swap executes across chains automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Cross-chain swaps take longer than single-chain swaps. Allow 5-15 minutes
  for completion depending on network conditions.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Swap taking longer than expected">
    Cross-chain swaps require message passing between networks.
    Allow 5-15 minutes for completion. Check your transaction on the
    source chain's block explorer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Received less than quoted">
    Price may have moved during cross-chain execution. For volatile pairs,
    consider adjusting slippage tolerance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Partner Documentation: Integration Approach

### partners/index.mdx — Update Value Proposition

**Current (Aerodrome):**
> "Launch tokens, bootstrap liquidity, and grow your protocol on Base"

**Velodrome version:**
> "Launch tokens, bootstrap liquidity, and grow your protocol across the Superchain"

**Add to "Key advantages":**

```mdx
- **Multi-chain reach**: Launch on one chain, attract liquidity across 10+
  Superchain networks from a single veVELO voter base
- **Unified incentives**: Single incentive deposit on Optimism reaches voters
  who direct emissions to pools on any chain
```

---

### partners/incentives.mdx — Add Multi-Chain Strategy Section

Add after "Incentive strategy considerations":

**New section: "Multi-chain incentive strategies"**

```mdx
## Multi-chain incentive strategies

Incentives deposited on Optimism attract votes from veVELO holders who can
direct emissions to pools on any Superchain network.

### Where to focus incentives

Consider where your protocol needs liquidity most:

- **Single-chain focus**: Concentrate incentives on one pool to maximize
  depth on your primary chain
- **Multi-chain presence**: Split incentives across pools on different
  chains to establish presence everywhere
- **Follow volume**: Incentivize pools on chains where your token already
  has trading activity

<Tip>
  Monitor vote distribution across chains. If a competing pool on another
  chain is attracting votes away from yours, consider matching incentives there.
</Tip>

### Timing considerations

Voters allocate voting power across all chains in a single epoch.
Coordinate your incentive deposits to compete effectively:

- Deposit incentives early in the epoch for visibility
- Announce multi-epoch commitments to attract long-term voters
- Track which chains your competitors are incentivizing
```

---

### partners/launcher.mdx — Add Chain Selection Guidance

Add an info block:

```mdx
<Info>
  Pools can be created on any Superchain network. Consider your target
  user base, existing ecosystem presence, and gas costs when choosing
  where to launch. You can create pools for the same token pair on
  multiple chains.
</Info>
```

---

## FAQ Additions

### faqs/users.mdx — Add Superchain Section

Add a new accordion group:

```mdx
## Multi-chain (Superchain)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need veVELO on every chain?">
    No. veVELO only exists on Optimism, but it controls voting for pools
    across all Superchain networks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where do I claim my rewards?">
    Rewards accrue on the chain where trading occurs. If you voted for
    a pool on Mode, claim those rewards on Mode by switching networks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is WETH used for when voting?">
    Cross-chain votes require message passing via Hyperlane. WETH covers
    the gas costs for delivering your vote to other chains. This is
    typically 0.001-0.01 WETH per cross-chain vote.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I bridge VELO to other chains?">
    Yes. VELO can be bridged as xVELO to any Superchain network. xVELO
    can be redeemed 1:1 for VELO on Optimism via the Lockbox contract.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What chains does Velodrome support?">
    Velodrome operates on Optimism (root chain for voting) plus 10 leaf
    chains: Mode, Lisk, Fraxtal, Metal, Soneium, Unichain, Celo, Ink,
    Superseed, and Swell.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

### faqs/partners.mdx — Add Multi-Chain Section

```mdx
## Multi-chain launches

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which chain should I launch on?">
    Consider your target users, existing ecosystem presence, and gas costs.
    You can create pools on multiple chains for the same token pair.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to deposit incentives on each chain?">
    No. Incentives are deposited on Optimism and attract votes from veVELO
    holders who can direct emissions to pools on any chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do emissions work across chains?">
    veVELO holders vote on Optimism. Votes are forwarded to each chain's
    gauges via cross-chain messaging. Emissions are distributed on each
    chain as xVELO.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

## Developer Documentation: Structure Changes

Developer docs require more structural changes due to per-chain deployments.

### development/index.mdx — Add Chain Context

Add a chain selector pattern or note that contracts are deployed per-chain:

```mdx
<Info>
  Velodrome contracts are deployed on each Superchain network. Use the
  chain-specific addresses below, or see the full deployment reference
  for all chains.
</Info>
```

### Per-Chain Deployment Reference

Options:
1. **Single page with tabs** — Use `<Tabs>` component to switch between chains
2. **Accordion per chain** — Collapsible sections for each chain's addresses
3. **Separate pages** — One page per chain (more SEO-friendly but more maintenance)

**Recommended: Tabs approach** (keeps it scannable):

```mdx
## Contract Addresses

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Optimism">
    | Contract | Address |
    | --- | --- |
    | Router | `0x...` |
    | Factory | `0x...` |
    | Voter | `0x...` |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mode">
    | Contract | Address |
    | --- | --- |
    | Router | `0x...` |
    | Factory | `0x...` |
    | LeafVoter | `0x...` |
  </Tab>
  <!-- Additional chains -->
</Tabs>
```
