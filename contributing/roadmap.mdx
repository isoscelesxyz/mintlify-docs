## 🔴 High Priority

### Advanced Topics Section

**Status**: Not started
**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard
**Estimated effort**: 6-8 hours across multiple pages
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Create a new "Advanced" section with deep-dive technical content:

1. **APR Calculations Guide** (`/advanced/apr-calculations.mdx`)
   - vAPR formula (veAERO voting APR)
   - LP APR calculation (fees + emissions)
   - CL APR with in-range considerations
   - Worked examples for each
   - Disclaimers: estimates only, not guarantees

2. **Impermanent Loss Education** (`/advanced/impermanent-loss.mdx`)
   - What is IL (fundamentals)
   - V2 pool IL mechanics
   - CL pool IL (amplified by concentration)
   - IL mitigation strategies
   - When fees offset IL

3. **Position Management Strategies** (`/advanced/strategies.mdx`)
   - V2 LP strategies (when to add/remove)
   - CL active management (range selection, rebalancing)
   - veNFT optimization (lock duration, merge/split tactics)
   - Portfolio allocation framework

4. **MetaDEX Technical Architecture** (`/advanced/architecture.mdx`)
   - Framework components (registry, flywheel, inflationary model)
   - Zero external dependencies (onchain API, static frontend)
   - Dynamic reward caps mechanism
   - Modular design advantages

**Skills needed:** Technical writing, DeFi understanding, no marketing language

---

### Risk Education Content

**Status**: Not started
**Difficulty**: Easy-Medium
**Estimated effort**: 2 hours
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Expand risk documentation across existing pages (not a new page):

- **CL-specific risks**: Out-of-range = zero earnings, faster IL, rebalancing costs
- **Permanent lock risk**: Cannot unlock AERO ever, only exit via selling veNFT
- **Relay manager trust**: Manager controls votes, deactivation scenarios
- **General DeFi risks**: Smart contract risk, market volatility

**Where to add:**

- Inline `<Warning>` components on relevant how-to pages
- Expand "Before You Begin" risk section
- Link to risks from troubleshooting sections

**Skills needed:** Clear risk communication, understanding DeFi risks, neutral tone

---

### Voting Strategies Guide

**Status**: Not started
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated effort**: 2 hours
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Create `/advanced/voting-strategies.mdx` covering:

- Understanding incentive types (bribes, fees, emissions)
- Pool selection mechanics ($/vote calculation)
- Vote allocation strategies (concentration vs diversification)
- Bribe market dynamics (how protocols compete)
- Risk considerations (pool rug risk, incentive sustainability)

**Critical requirement:** Educational and mechanical only. **No investment advice**. Include heavy disclaimers.

**Skills needed:** DeFi governance understanding, technical writing, neutral educational tone

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### APR Calculations Guide (Standalone)

**Status**: Not started
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Create `/advanced/apr-calculations.mdx`:

- **vAPR (veAERO voting APR)**: Formula currently TODO everywhere - needs team input
- **LP APR components**: Swap fee APR + emissions APR calculations
- **CL APR considerations**: In-range time percentage, dynamic fees
- **Worked examples**: Step-by-step calculations for V2, CL, and veAERO
- **Caveats**: Heavy disclaimers (estimates, not guarantees, past ≠ future)

**Blocker:** vAPR formula needs to be provided by the Aerodrome team

**Skills needed:** Financial calculations, clear technical explanations, DeFi APR understanding

---

### Impermanent Loss Education (Standalone)

**Status**: Not started
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated effort**: 2 hours
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Create `/advanced/impermanent-loss.mdx`:

- IL fundamentals (what it is, why "impermanent")
- V2 pool IL mechanics (50/50 rebalancing)
- CL pool IL (amplified by concentration, out-of-range = 100% conversion)
- IL mitigation strategies (correlated pairs, wider ranges, high-fee pools)
- IL calculators and formulas
- When fees offset IL (high volume pools)

**Skills needed:** DeFi LP understanding, ability to explain complex concepts simply

---

### Position Management Strategies (Standalone)

**Status**: Not started
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated effort**: 3 hours
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Create `/advanced/strategies.mdx`:

- V2 LP strategies (when to add/remove, rebalancing decisions)
- CL active management (range selection methodology, rebalancing triggers, multi-position laddering)
- veNFT optimization (lock duration choice, merge/split tactics, delegation strategies)
- Portfolio allocation framework (LP vs veNFT balance, diversification)

**Critical requirement:** Educational content, not financial advice. Clear disclaimers.

**Skills needed:** Advanced DeFi strategy understanding, clear educational writing

---

### MetaDEX Technical Architecture (Standalone)

**Status**: Not started
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated effort**: 2 hours
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Create `/advanced/metadex-architecture.mdx` or enhance `/overview/contributors/dromos-labs.mdx`:

- Framework components (registry, flywheel, inflationary model)
- Zero external dependencies (completely onchain, Sugar API, static IPFS frontend)
- Privacy-oriented design (no tracking, user RPC endpoints)
- Dynamic reward caps mechanism
- Modular design advantages

**Source:** `/Users/liam/Sites/docs-exploration/raw-data/google-drive/MetaDEX.md` (has incomplete sections - only document completed content)

**Skills needed:** Technical architecture writing, blockchain infrastructure understanding

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have

### Interactive/Visual Content

**Status**: Blocked (requires design/dev collaboration)
**Difficulty**: Hard
**Estimated effort**: 8+ hours (requires custom development)
**GitHub Issue**: [#TBD](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/issues)

Potential interactive elements:

1. **Epoch Timeline Diagram**: Visual weekly cycle with countdown
2. **Lock Duration → Voting Power Calculator**: Input AERO amount + duration, output veAERO
3. **CL Range Visualizer**: Price chart with range overlay, in-range percentage
4. **Pool Type Decision Tree**: Interactive questions recommending V2 vs CL
5. **APR Breakdown Calculator**: Input pool parameters, show fees + emissions + bribes
6. **Vote Split Simulator**: Allocate percentages, preview outcomes

**Note:** These require custom components or external tools. Consider starting with static diagrams.

**Skills needed:** React development, data visualization, design skills
