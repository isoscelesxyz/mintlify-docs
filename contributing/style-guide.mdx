description: "Standards and conventions for Aerodrome documentation"
---

This guide ensures consistency across all Aerodrome documentation. Follow these standards when contributing.

## Documentation Philosophy

Aerodrome documentation is **task-oriented, not marketing**. Every page should enable the reader to complete at least one concrete job. If a page does not serve a clear user task, it should be split into actionable components or removed.

### Core Principles

- **Focus on user jobs**: What can the reader do after reading this page?
- **Prefer concrete tasks** over abstract descriptions
- **State the primary audience** explicitly when drafting a page
- **Verify content matches** that audience's needs

## Voice and Tone

### Writing Style

Documentation should be:

- **Calm and technical**: No hype, no marketing language, no speculation
- **Direct and precise**: Use second person ("you"), active voice, short sentences
- **Risk-aware**: Always mention relevant risks where appropriate
- **Neutral on outcomes**: Never promise yields, returns, or specific results

### What to Avoid

Never:

- Recommend specific trades or investment strategies
- Use "guaranteed", "risk-free", "safe yield", or similar absolute terms
- Make price predictions or speculate on token valuations
- Use excessive slang or casual language
- Use emojis in documentation body text (allowed in UI elements, not prose)

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Good Examples">
    - "When you lock AERO, you receive veAERO voting power proportional to your lock duration"
    - "CL pools require active management to maintain positions within price ranges"
    - "Voting rewards include trading fees and bribes from the previous epoch"
    - "Permanent locks cannot be reversed - AERO is locked forever"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="❌ Bad Examples">
    - "Lock AERO to earn massive rewards!" (hype, promises)
    - "This pool is guaranteed to generate high yields" (absolute claim)
    - "AERO price will definitely increase" (speculation)
    - "Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity! 🚀" (marketing, emoji)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Risk Communication

### When to Include Risk Warnings

Use `<Warning>` components for **page-specific risks only**:

- Risks unique to that particular operation or feature
- Technical gotchas specific to that page's content
- Critical safety issues that apply to that specific action

**Examples of appropriate inline warnings:**

- "CL pools require active management to stay in range"
- "Relocking extends your lock duration - you cannot unlock early"
- "Voting locks your tokens for the full epoch"

### What NOT to Warn About on Every Page

**DO NOT include generic warnings** on every page:

- ❌ "You need a wallet" (basic assumption)
- ❌ "Smart contracts have risks" (covered in disclaimers)
- ❌ "Impermanent loss exists" (unless specific to that pool type)
- ❌ "Verify contract addresses" (general best practice)

**For general protocol risks**: Link to [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin) instead of repeating generic warnings.

### Never Encourage

- Leverage, looping, or high-risk strategies
- Specific investment amounts or timing
- Trading strategies or price predictions

## Terminology

Always use these terms consistently:

### Aerodrome-Specific Terms

- **`AERO`** - The protocol token. Always format with backticks in markdown
- **veAERO** - Vote-escrowed AERO (locked AERO for governance). Always "veAERO", never "veAero" or "VeAERO"
- **Epochs** - Capitalize when referring to the concept
- **MetaDEX** - Not "Meta-DEX" or "metaDEX"
- **Gauges, Bribes, Emissions** - Capitalize when referring to concepts
- **Slipstream** - Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity implementation
- **Sugar** - The on-chain API (capitalize as a proper noun)

### General DeFi Terms

Use tooltips on first mention of advanced terms:

```markdown
<Tooltip tip="The difference between quoted and executed price">slippage</Tooltip>
```

Common terms to tooltip: slippage, price impact, impermanent loss, liquidity depth, concentrated liquidity, vote-escrow, bribes, emissions, rebases

## Page Structure

### Required Frontmatter

Every `.mdx` page must include:

```yaml
---
title: "Clear, concise page title"
description: "One-sentence summary for SEO and previews (max 160 chars)"
---
```

### Content Structure Patterns

**For How-To Guides:**

1. Start with "You will learn how to X and why it matters"
2. Include `## Before you begin` section with prerequisites
3. Use `<Steps>` component for sequential instructions
4. End with `## Next steps` linking to related content

**For Concept Pages:**

1. Start with "In this concept" summary
2. Explain the mental model and why it matters
3. Provide a simple, concrete example
4. End with "Where to go next"

**For Reference Pages:**

1. Start with brief description of the reference material
2. Use tables for structured data (addresses, parameters, endpoints)
3. Include code examples where relevant
4. Keep explanations minimal (link to concepts for details)

## Mintlify Components

### Must Use These Components

- `<Steps>` - For any process with 2+ sequential actions
- `<Warning>` - For risks (NOT `<Callout type="warning">`)
- `<Info>` - For helpful context and tips
- `<Tip>` - For pro tips and optimizations
- `<Accordion>` and `<AccordionGroup>` - For troubleshooting and FAQs
- `<Card>` and `<CardGroup>` - For "Next steps" navigation
- `<Tooltip>` - For inline definitions of technical terms

### When to Use Tabs

Use `<Tabs>` **only** when content differs by protocol or chain:

```markdown
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Aerodrome (Base)">
    Content specific to Aerodrome on Base
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Velodrome (Optimism)">
    Content specific to Velodrome on Optimism
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

**Do NOT use tabs** for general alternatives or different approaches.

## Code Examples

### Keep Examples Focused

- One concept per code block
- Include comments for clarity
- Use realistic, not placeholder values
- Always specify the language

## Data Accuracy

### Critical Rule: Never Guess Data

When documenting addresses, parameters, or numeric values:

- **Always** pull from canonical sources
- **Never** guess, estimate, or use placeholder values
- **If unavailable**: Write `TODO: VERIFY FROM [source]` and flag for review

### Canonical Sources

**Contract addresses:**

- Only from verified sources (official contract addresses page or BaseScan)

**Token metadata:**

- Only from verified blockchain data

**Emissions schedules, parameters:**

- Only from single reference page in `/overview/tokenomics/emissions.mdx`
- Never duplicate parameters across pages - link instead

**Governance parameters:**

- Only from contract source code or official governance docs
- Document source in comments

## Navigation and Links

### Internal Links

Always use relative paths:

```markdown
See [Lock AERO](/overview/core-features/lock) for details.
```

### External Links

Open in new tab when linking outside docs:

```markdown
Visit [BaseScan](https://basescan.org) to verify addresses.
```

### Images

Store in `/images/` and reference with absolute paths:

```markdown
![Description](/images/filename.svg)
```

## File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `lock-aero.mdx`
- Be descriptive: `providing-liquidity.mdx` not `liquidity.mdx`
- Match navigation structure
