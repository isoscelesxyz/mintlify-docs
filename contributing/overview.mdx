## Before You Start

1. **Read the [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide)** to understand our documentation philosophy, voice, and standards
2. **Check the [Docs Roadmap](/contributing/roadmap)** for areas where we need help
3. **Review existing pages** to match the tone and structure

## Documentation Philosophy

Aerodrome documentation is **task-oriented, not marketing**. Every page should enable the reader to complete at least one concrete job.

- **Be calm and technical**: No hype, no speculation
- **Be direct and precise**: Use second person ("you"), active voice, short sentences
- **Be risk-aware**: Always mention relevant risks appropriately
- **Be accurate**: Never guess data - link to canonical sources

See the full philosophy in our [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide).
