Relay is an automated veAERO management system for users who want hands-free position maintenance and optimized voting strategies.

In this concept, you'll learn how Relay works, the difference between compounder and convertor strategies, and how depositing your <Tooltip tip="Vote-escrowed AERO tokens locked for governance">veAERO</Tooltip> into a Relay affects your position and governance rights.

## How Relay works

When you deposit your veAERO into a Relay, the system automates several key functions:

- **Auto max-lock**: Your veAERO lock duration automatically extends to the maximum (4 years) and maintains that duration
- **Automatic voting**: The Relay strategy votes on your behalf each <Tooltip tip="7-day governance period from Thursday 00:00 UTC to Wednesday 23:59 UTC">epoch</Tooltip> according to its programmed logic
- **Rebase auto-compounding**: Weekly <Tooltip tip="Emissions distributed to veAERO holders based on their voting power">rebases</Tooltip> are automatically claimed and added to your locked position
- **Reward handling**: Trading fees and bribes are processed according to your chosen strategy type (see below)

<Warning>
Depositing into a Relay automatically sets your veAERO to max-lock (4 years). You cannot unlock early, and withdrawals are only possible after the first epoch completes.
</Warning>

## Strategy types

Relay offers two strategy types that handle rewards differently:

### Compounders

**Goal**: Maximize veAERO voting power over time

Compounders automatically claim all rewards (rebases, trading fees, and <Tooltip tip="Incentives deposited by protocols to attract votes to their gauges">bribes</Tooltip>) and convert them to `AERO`, then lock that `AERO` to increase your veAERO position. This strategy votes for pools that generate high total rewards by value.

**Best for**: Users who want to grow their veAERO holdings and don't need liquid yield.

### Convertors

**Goal**: Generate liquid yield while maintaining veAERO exposure

Convertors compound rebases into your veAERO position (like compounders), but convert all other rewards into a specified asset (such as USDC, ETH, or OP) that you can claim weekly. The voting strategy may prioritize pools containing the target asset.

**Best for**: Users who want regular claimable income while maintaining their veAERO position.

<Warning>
Withdrawals from Relay are only possible after the first epoch completes. Do not deposit if you need immediate access to your veAERO.
</Warning>

## Available Relay strategies

### Protocol-run Relays

The **veAERO MAXI Relay** uses a compounder strategy with these functions:

- **Voting**: Votes for pools that historically generate high reward value
- **Rebasing**: Claims the weekly rebase
- **Rewards conversion**: Claims and converts rewards into `AERO`
- **Locking**: Locks all converted `AERO`, increasing the locked amount of those who deposited into the Relay

### Partner Relays

Partner Relay strategies are run by or for protocol partners—usually other protocols with the goal of supporting specific liquidity pools.

These strategies typically vote to support their own liquidity pools. Partner protocols may generate different reward profiles based on their pool focus compared to the veAERO MAXI strategy.

Partner protocols can request a Relay strategy. This may soon require an open governance proposal to be voted and passed by veAERO voters.

## Technical architecture

Relay strategies use special managed veNFTs called <Tooltip tip="Managed veNFT that aggregates voting power from deposited veAERO positions">**(m)veNFTs**</Tooltip> that aggregate voting power from multiple deposited veAERO positions.

When you deposit your veAERO into a Relay:

1. Your veNFT's voting power is transferred to the Relay's (m)veNFT
2. The Relay strategy manager (protocol or partner) controls voting for the (m)veNFT
3. When you withdraw, your veNFT receives its share of the aggregated voting power
4. Your lock duration is set to maximum (4 years)

Relay strategies are automated and operated by a decentralized network, with the exception of voting, which is handled by the (m)veNFT managers.

<Info>
If a Relay strategy encounters issues, the protocol can deactivate the (m)veNFT, allowing you to safely withdraw your veAERO.

## Governance rights

Depositors retain their governance voting power. The protocol Governor tracks and reports the current locked amount of veNFTs managed by each Relay strategy, ensuring your governance weight is preserved even while deposited.
