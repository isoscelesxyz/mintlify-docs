Each week, veAERO holders vote to direct AERO emissions to liquidity pools. In exchange, the voters for each pool share the swap fees generated by the staked liquidity in that pool + 10% of fees from unstaked concentrated liquidity + voting incentives. Votes each epoch are due by Wednesday at 23:00 UTC, 1 hour before the next epoch begins. The two hours after the vote closes are reserved for protocol operations/automations.

To vote on Aerodrome:

1. Create a lock (see "How to lock")
2. On vote screen, identify pools where you would like to cast your vote using the sort function or by searching for token symbol or address
3. On the pool you'd like to vote for, hit "Select" in the bottom-right corner and choose which lock you want to vote with (you may have only one lock)
4. Select "Vote"
5. On the following screen you have the ability to divide your vote, as a percentage, across the pools you've selected for each lock. Use the arrows on the side of the percentage field to adjust by increments of 5%. Unallocated vote-power (if < 100%) will be split proportionally among the selected pools. Each Lock (veNFT) can only cast votes once per epoch.
6. Once 100% of your votes have been allocated, select "Vote" for each lock and approve in your wallet.
7. Your votes will automatically carry on to the following epoch unless adjusted.
8. If you'd prefer a more automated voting experience, you can deposit your lock into a Relay

Note: If you increased your Lock's (veNFT) balance during the epoch, recast your vote to allocate your vote-power in full. Unchanged votes carry over into the next epoch.

## Rewards

Voting rewards for a given epoch will appear in your Dashboard after the epoch change on Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Rebase rewards for new locks will appear after the second epoch change.
