Aerodrome Finance enables users to securely swap tokens with low fees and minimal slippage. This functionality is powered by liquidity pools: pairs of tokens, deposited by users, that are available for trading 24/7. Aerodrome offers two pool types: Basic and Concentrated. Basic pools make all liquidity available for trading at all prices. Concentrated pools require LPs to identify specific price ranges where their liquidity will be active.

Both Basic and Concentrated pools can be optimized for different asset relationships:

**Volatile**

Tokens with high price volatility (e.g. `AERO/ETH`, `WETH/USDC`). These pools use a generic AMM formula: <Latex>x × y ≥ k</Latex>

This constant product formula enables price discovery between assets with different volatility profiles while maintaining pool balance.

**Stable**

Tokens which have little to no volatility (e.g. `cbBTC/wBTC`, `USDC/USDT`). The formula used for pricing tokens allows for low slippage even on large traded volumes: <Latex>x³y + xy³ ≥ k</Latex>

This specialized curve dramatically reduces slippage for similar-value tokens, enabling efficient large-volume trades with minimal price impact.

Both **Stable** and **Volatile** formulas maintain constant pool liquidity while optimizing for their specific use cases. Below, you can find a visual comparison between the stable (red) and volatile (blue) AMM pricing equations:

- **x**: Amount of first token in the pool
- **y**: Amount of second token in the same pool
- **k**: A fixed constant

_Aerodrome also supports custom factories, so new pool types can be integrated in the future._
