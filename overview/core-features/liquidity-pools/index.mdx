Liquidity pools power token swaps on Aerodrome. Users deposit token pairs into pools, enabling 24/7 trading. In return, liquidity providers (LPs) earn swap fees or `AERO` emissions.

<Warning>
  Providing liquidity involves risks including impermanent loss, smart contract risk, and potential
  loss of capital. Read [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin) before
  depositing.
</Warning>

Aerodrome offers two pool types:

1. **Basic pools** spread your liquidity across all prices: set-and-forget.
2. **Concentrated pools** let you focus liquidity within specific price ranges: higher efficiency, active management required.

For the best of both worlds, **Autopilot** is an automated liquidity management solution for concentrated pools. You can deposit into a concentrated pool and let Autopilot manage your position for you.
