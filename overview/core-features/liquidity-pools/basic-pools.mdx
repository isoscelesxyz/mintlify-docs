Basic pools use full-range liquidity provision, meaning all deposited tokens are available for trading at every possible price. These pools reward each LP evenly, proportional to their share of deposited assets.

## Benefits for LPs

- **Deposit once**: Low gas fees, no rebalancing or management required
- **Always-on liquidity**: Earn rewards from every trade in the pool

## Volatile vs Stable

<PoolTypes />

Below is a visual comparison of the stable (red) and volatile (blue) AMM pricing curves:

- **x**: Amount of first token in the pool
- **y**: Amount of second token in the pool
- **k**: A fixed constant

## How Basic pools work

**Liquidity distribution**: All deposits are spread uniformly across the entire price curve from 0 to ∞. Every trade at any price generates rewards for all LPs proportional to their pool share.

**Automatic rebalancing**: Pools adjust token ratios automatically as prices change. No user intervention needed.
