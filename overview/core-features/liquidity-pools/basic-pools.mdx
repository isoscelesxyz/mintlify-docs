Basic pools use full-range liquidity provision, meaning all deposited tokens are available for trading at every possible price. These pools reward each LP evenly, proportional to their share of deposited assets.

## Benefits for LPs

- Deposit once: low gas fees, no rebalancing or management required
- Always-on liquidity: earn steady returns based on market activity
