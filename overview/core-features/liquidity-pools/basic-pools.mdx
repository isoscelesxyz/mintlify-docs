This concept page helps **liquidity providers seeking passive returns** understand Basic pools. You will learn how <Tooltip tip="Liquidity available at all prices from 0 to infinity">full-range liquidity</Tooltip> works, when to choose Basic over Concentrated pools, and the trade-offs involved.

Basic pools use full-range liquidity provision, meaning all deposited tokens are available for trading at every possible price. These pools reward each LP evenly, proportional to their share of deposited assets.

## Benefits for LPs

- **Deposit once**: Low gas fees, no rebalancing or management required
- **Always-on liquidity**: Earn steady returns based on market activity

---

**Liquidity Distribution**

All deposits are spread uniformly across the entire price curve with these characteristics:

- **Uniform coverage**: All deposits span from 0 to ∞ prices
- **Continuous rewards**: Every trade at any price level generates rewards for all positions
- **No idle capital**: No "dead zones" where capital sits unused
- **Proportional collection**: Rewards are collected proportionally to each LP's pool share

**Rebalancing Mechanism**

Pools maintain optimal balance automatically:

- **Automatic adjustment**: Pools rebalance as prices change
- **Optimal ratios**: Maintains optimal ratios for continued trading
- **Zero management**: No user intervention needed

**Fee Structure**

Fees vary by pool type:

- **Volatile Pools**: 0.30% per trade (standard)
- **Stable Pools**: 0.05% per trade (optimized for volume)
