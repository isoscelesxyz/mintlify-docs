Slipstream is Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity (CL) solution. Concentrated pools require liquidity providers to deposit their capital within specific price ranges. With Slipstream, LPs can earn higher rewards while providing better execution for traders, but there is also an increased risk of idle liquidity if it is not properly managed.

<Warning>
CL pools require active management to stay in range. If market prices move outside your chosen range, your position becomes temporarily inactive and stops earning rewards until the price returns to your range or you adjust your position.
</Warning>

## Benefits

- **Higher capital efficiency**: Earn better returns in optimal scenarios
- **Superior reward generation**: Earn more rewards per unit of capital deployed

---

**Range Selection**

LPs choose specific price ranges (ticks) where their liquidity will be active. When the market price falls within this range, the position earns rewards. When outside the range, the position is temporarily inactive but preserves capital.

**Tick System**

Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity pools use "tick spacing," which refers to the minimum price movement between liquidity ranges. Each pool type has a different tick spacing:

- **Stable token pools**: 0.5% price range boundary (tick space 50)
- **Volatile token pools**: 2% price range boundary (tick space 200)
- **Highly correlated tokens**: 0.01% price range boundary (tick space 1) for stablecoins and liquid-staked tokens
- **Emerging tokens**: 20% price range boundary (tick space 2000) for tokens like AERO and VELO to reduce rebalancing needs

The tick spacing for concentrated liquidity pools is identified in their pool title. For example, "CL1-wstETH/WETH" indicates tick spacing of 1, suggesting the token prices are closely correlated.

## Concentrated Liquidity Pool Fees

Pool swap fees are designed to be adjusted independently from the pool type. Fees can reflect partner protocols' needs and be adjusted based on the market's volatility. To reduce operational overhead, we are working on a dynamic fee module that will adjust fees based on demand.

## The Slipstream Advantage

Slipstream outcompetes competitive concentrated liquidity solutions with these key features:

**Wider Tick Spacing**

Increased tick spacing means LPs stay in the active tick for longer, significantly increasing rewards over time.

**Active Tick Rewards**

AERO emissions are only streamed to the active tick, rewarding LPs in that range with even higher incentives.

**Emissions Structure**

Aerodrome rewards LPs with `AERO` tokens. The value of emissions is often higher than swap fees in the same period. LPs can also choose not to stake their liquidity and earn swap fees instead.

<Info>
With Slipstream V2, fees dynamically adjust based on market conditions and price volatility. LPs can choose to temporarily unstake deposits to maximize fee capture during high-volatility periods.
