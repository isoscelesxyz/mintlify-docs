Slipstream is Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity (CL) solution. Concentrated pools require liquidity providers to deposit their capital within specific price ranges. With Slipstream, LPs can earn higher rewards while providing better execution for traders, but there is also an increased risk of idle liquidity if it is not properly managed.

<Warning>
  CL pools require management to stay in range. If market prices move outside your chosen range,
  your position becomes temporarily inactive and stops earning rewards until the price returns to
  your range or you adjust your position.
</Warning>

## Benefits

- **Higher capital efficiency**: Earn better returns in optimal scenarios
- **Superior reward generation**: Earn more rewards per unit of capital deployed

---

**Range Selection**

LPs choose specific price ranges (ticks) where their liquidity will be active. When the market price falls within this range, the position earns rewards. When outside the range, the position is temporarily inactive but preserves capital.

**Tick System**

Concentrated liquidity pools use <Tooltip tip="The minimum price movement between liquidity ranges">"tick spacing,"</Tooltip> which refers to the minimum price movement between liquidity ranges. Smaller tick spacing allows tighter price ranges but requires more active management. The tick spacing is displayed just below the pool name. (e.g., "Concentrated Volatile 100" = tick spacing 100, or "Concentrated Stable 1" = tick spacing 1).

See [Tick spacing by pool type](#tick-spacing-by-pool-type) for the full list of available tick spacings and their typical use cases.

## Dynamic Fees

Slipstream implements **dynamic fee structures** that automatically adjust swap fees in real-time based on market volatility—similar to surge pricing in traditional markets.

### How dynamic fees work

**In volatile markets:**

- Fees increase to reflect heightened execution demand
- Higher returns for LPs during periods when traders are fee-inelastic
- Traders willing to pay premium fees for immediate execution

**In stable markets:**

- Fees decrease to attract more volume
- Increases liquidity utilization while positions stay in range
- Competitive pricing when traders are fee-elastic (shopping for best rates)

### Fee algorithm parameters

The dynamic fee system operates entirely onchain without external oracles or CEX price feeds. Key parameters include:

**Volatility scaling:**

- Monitors price deviation from moving average over customizable time window
- Smooth, prompt response to volatility changes
- Optimized for trade execution quality

**Base fee and fee cap:**

- **Base fee**: Charged during low volatility periods
- **Fee cap**: Maximum fee during high volatility
- Parameters tuned for competitiveness against fixed-fee AMMs

### Benefits for different LP types

**For staked LPs (earning emissions):**

- Higher fee capture flows to veAERO voters during volatile periods
- Increased long-term payouts over multiple epochs
- Benefits from both emissions and fee revenue

**For unstaked LPs (earning fees):**

- Consistently rewarded closer to optimal market rate
- Can capitalize on high-volatility fee surges
- Orderbook-like execution efficiency onchain

## Tick Spacing

Slipstream uses **wider tick spacing** than some other CL implementations. Wider tick spacing means positions stay in range longer, reducing management overhead for LPs.

### How wider tick spacing affects LPs

**Better LP management:**

- LPs stay in active tick ranges longer
- Reduced rebalancing frequency = lower gas costs
- Significantly increased rewards over time

**Superior TVL utilization:**

- Greater liquidity depth per active range
- Better execution for traders
- Higher volume capture per dollar of liquidity

<Info>
  Wider tick spacing is practically more efficient for LPs. While narrow ticks offer theoretical
  capital efficiency, they require constant management. Wider spacing balances efficiency with
  usability.
</Info>

### Tick spacing by pool type

Available tick spacings optimized for different asset correlations:

| Tick Spacing | Fee   | Best For                                        |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | 0.01% | Highly correlated (LSTs like wstETH/WETH)       |
| 10           | 0.05% | Stable pairs (USDC/USDT)                        |
| 50           | 0.05% | Stable pairs                                    |
| 100          | 0.05% | Correlated volatile pairs                       |
| 200          | 0.30% | Standard volatile pairs (AERO/WETH, USDC/WETH)  |
| 2000         | 1.00% | Emerging tokens (new launches, high volatility) |

The tick spacing is displayed just below the pool name. (e.g., "Concentrated Volatile 100" = tick spacing 100, or "Concentrated Stable 1" = tick spacing 1).

## The Unstaked Fee Rake

Slipstream offers LPs the choice between two earning strategies:

### Staked positions

- Earn `AERO` emissions based on veAERO votes
- Forfeit swap fees (100% go to voters)
- Best when emissions APR \> fee APR

### Unstaked positions

- Earn **90% of swap fees** directly
- **10% of fees** (the "rake") go to veAERO voters
- Earn **zero emissions**
- Best during high-volatility periods when fees surge above emissions

<Warning>
  The 10% unstaked fee rake ensures veAERO voters still benefit from your liquidity even when you're
  unstaked. This alignment incentivizes voters to vote for your pool.
</Warning>

## Managing CL Positions

### Choosing your price range

**Narrow ranges (1-5% price range):**

- Higher capital efficiency = more fees per dollar
- Requires active monitoring and frequent rebalancing
- Best for: Stable pairs (USDC/DAI), experienced LPs, high-volume pools

**Wide ranges (10-50% price range):**

- Lower capital efficiency but less management
- Stays in range longer during volatility
- Best for: Volatile pairs (AERO/WETH), passive LPs, lower-volume pools

**Consider:**

- Historical price volatility of the pair
- Your time commitment for rebalancing
- Fee tier of the pool (higher fees = wider ranges acceptable)

<Tip>Check the pool's 7-day price range on the Aerodrome app to inform your range selection.</Tip>

### What happens when price moves out of range

When the active price exits your selected range:

1. **You stop earning fees** - No swap activity occurs within your range
2. **No emissions if staked** - Staked CL positions only earn when in range
3. **Your position converts to 100% of one token** - Acts as a limit order
4. **You need to rebalance** - Either adjust your range or accept zero rewards

**To rebalance:**

- Remove liquidity from the current position
- Select a new range around current price
- Re-add liquidity (requires approvals and gas)

**Alternatives:**

- Use multiple positions with laddered ranges
- Use [Autopilot](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/autopilot) for automated rebalancing

### Adding or removing liquidity

**Adding liquidity to existing position:**

- CL positions are NFTs representing specific ranges
- You **cannot** add to an existing NFT position
- Instead, create a new position with the same range parameters
- You'll have multiple NFTs for the same range

**Removing liquidity:**

<Steps>
  <Step>Navigate to your position in the Aerodrome app</Step>
  <Step>Click "Remove Liquidity"</Step>
  <Step>Choose amount to remove (partial or full)</Step>
  <Step>Confirm transaction</Step>
  <Step>Receive both tokens based on current price and your range</Step>
</Steps>

**Partial removal**: You can remove a percentage of your position while keeping the rest active.

<Info>
  Unlike V2 pools where you can add to existing positions, CL positions are individual NFTs that
  cannot be merged.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I rebalance a CL position?">
    Manual rebalancing requires removing and re-adding liquidity:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Remove current position">
        Go to your CL position and click "Remove Liquidity." You'll receive both tokens based on the current price.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select new range">
        Create a new position with an updated price range centered around the current market price.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add liquidity">
        Deposit both tokens into the new range. Approve tokens if first time.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Stake for emissions">
        If the pool has a gauge, stake your new position to earn AERO emissions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    **Gas costs**: Each rebalance requires multiple transactions (remove, approve, add, stake).

    **Autopilot alternative**: [Autopilot](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/autopilot) handles rebalancing automatically with no management fees.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I claim CL fees?">
    CL position fees accumulate automatically. To claim:

    1. Go to your Dashboard
    2. Find your CL position
    3. Click "Claim Fees"
    4. Receive fees in both pool tokens

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are my CL fees lower than expected?">
    Several factors affect CL fee earnings:

    **Your position is out of range:**

    - Check if current price is within your selected range
    - Out-of-range positions earn zero fees

    **Low trading volume:**

    - Fees come from swap activity
    - Check pool's 24h volume on the pool page

    **Wide price range:**

    - Wider ranges earn proportionally less per swap
    - Your capital is spread across more price points

    **Position is staked:**

    - If staked, you forfeit fees for AERO emissions
    - Check if "Staked" indicator is active on your position

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my tokens when out of range?">
    When price exits your range, your position gradually converts to 100% of one token:

    **Price above range:**

    - Position becomes 100% of the lower-priced token
    - Example: USDC/WETH pool, price rises → you hold 100% USDC

    **Price below range:**

    - Position becomes 100% of the higher-priced token
    - Example: USDC/WETH pool, price falls → you hold 100% WETH

    **This is automatic and irreversible while out of range.** Your position acts like a limit order until price returns or you rebalance.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I use narrow or wide ranges?">
    The right range depends on your goals and commitment level:

    **Use narrow ranges (1-5%) if:**

    - You can actively monitor and rebalance
    - Pool has stable price action (stablecoins)
    - High swap volume justifies management effort
    - You're experienced with CL mechanics

    **Use wide ranges (10-50%) if:**

    - You prefer passive management
    - Pool has volatile price action
    - Lower volume doesn't justify frequent rebalancing
    - You're new to CL or testing strategies

    **Hybrid approach:**

    - Create multiple positions with different ranges
    - Narrow range for higher fees when in range
    - Wide range as backstop for volatility

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I stake my CL position?">
    Common reasons:

    **Pool has no gauge:**

    - Not all pools are eligible for emissions
    - Check if pool appears on the [Vote page](https://aerodrome.finance/vote)
    - Only whitelisted pools with gauges can be staked

    **Position already staked:**

    - Check your Dashboard for staking status
    - You may need to unstake first if managing the position

    **Wallet connection issue:**

    - Ensure you're connected with the wallet that holds the NFT
    - CL positions are NFTs - verify you own the token ID
