description: "Slipstream concentrated liquidity pools with custom price ranges for capital-efficient liquidity provision"

This guide helps **active liquidity providers** and **protocol teams** understand Slipstream <Tooltip tip="Liquidity deposited within specific price ranges for higher capital efficiency">concentrated liquidity</Tooltip>. You will learn how to choose <Tooltip tip="Specific price points where liquidity can be placed">tick ranges</Tooltip>, manage CL positions, and maximize capital efficiency.

Slipstream is Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity (CL) solution. Concentrated pools require liquidity providers to deposit their capital within specific price ranges. With Slipstream, LPs can earn higher rewards while providing better execution for traders, but there is also an increased risk of idle liquidity if it is not properly managed.

<Warning>
CL pools require active management to stay in range. If market prices move outside your chosen range, your position becomes temporarily inactive and stops earning rewards until the price returns to your range or you adjust your position.
</Warning>

## Benefits

- **Higher capital efficiency**: Earn better returns in optimal scenarios
- **Superior reward generation**: Earn more rewards per unit of capital deployed

---

**Range Selection**

LPs choose specific price ranges (ticks) where their liquidity will be active. When the market price falls within this range, the position earns rewards. When outside the range, the position is temporarily inactive but preserves capital.

**Tick System**

Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity pools use <Tooltip tip="The minimum price movement between liquidity ranges">"tick spacing,"</Tooltip> which refers to the minimum price movement between liquidity ranges. Each pool type has a different tick spacing:

- **Stable token pools**: 0.5% price range boundary (tick space 50)
- **Volatile token pools**: 2% price range boundary (tick space 200)
- **Highly correlated tokens**: 0.01% price range boundary (tick space 1) for stablecoins and liquid-staked tokens
- **Emerging tokens**: 20% price range boundary (tick space 2000) for tokens like AERO and VELO to reduce rebalancing needs

The tick spacing for concentrated liquidity pools is identified in their pool title. For example, "CL1-wstETH/WETH" indicates tick spacing of 1, suggesting the token prices are closely correlated.

## Dynamic Fees (Slipstream V2)

Slipstream V2 implements **dynamic fee structures** that automatically adjust swap fees in real-time based on market volatility—similar to surge pricing in traditional markets.

### How dynamic fees work

**In volatile markets:**
- Fees increase to reflect heightened execution demand
- Higher returns for LPs during periods when traders are fee-inelastic
- Traders willing to pay premium fees for immediate execution

**In stable markets:**
- Fees decrease to attract more volume
- Increases liquidity utilization while positions stay in range
- Competitive pricing when traders are fee-elastic (shopping for best rates)

### Fee algorithm parameters

The dynamic fee system operates entirely onchain without external oracles or CEX price feeds. Key parameters include:

**Volatility scaling:**
- Monitors price deviation from moving average over customizable time window
- Smooth, prompt response to volatility changes
- Optimized for trade execution quality

**Base fee and fee cap:**
- **Base fee**: Charged during low volatility periods
- **Fee cap**: Maximum fee during high volatility
- Parameters tuned for competitiveness against fixed-fee AMMs

<Tip>
Dynamic fees enable Slipstream to compete effectively across market conditions—lowering fees to capture volume in stable markets, raising fees to maximize LP earnings during volatility.
</Tip>

### Benefits for different LP types

**For staked LPs (earning emissions):**
- Higher fee capture flows to veAERO voters during volatile periods
- Increased long-term payouts over multiple epochs
- Benefits from both emissions and fee revenue

**For unstaked LPs (earning fees):**
- Consistently rewarded closer to optimal market rate
- Can capitalize on high-volatility fee surges
- Orderbook-like execution efficiency onchain

## Tick Spacing Optimization

One of Slipstream's key advantages is **wider tick spacing** compared to competitors like Uniswap V3.

### Why wider tick spacing matters

**Better LP management:**
- LPs stay in active tick ranges longer
- Reduced rebalancing frequency = lower gas costs
- Significantly increased rewards over time

**Superior TVL utilization:**
- Greater liquidity depth per active range
- Better execution for traders
- Higher volume capture per dollar of liquidity

**Example comparison (WETH/USDC):**
- Uniswap V3: 10 tick spacing (0.1%)
- Slipstream: 100 tick spacing (1%)
- **Result**: Slipstream achieves better liquidity utilization despite theoretically lower capital efficiency

<Info>
Wider tick spacing is practically more efficient for LPs. While narrow ticks offer theoretical capital efficiency, they require constant management. Wider spacing balances efficiency with usability.
</Info>

### Tick spacing by pool type

Available tick spacings optimized for different asset correlations:

| Tick Spacing | Price Range | Best For |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | 0.01% | Highly correlated (stablecoins, LSTs like wstETH/WETH) |
| 10 | 0.05% | Stable/pegged assets (USDC/USDT) |
| 50 | 0.5% | Correlated stable tokens |
| 100 | 0.5% | Correlated volatiles |
| 200 | 2% | Standard volatile pairs (AERO/WETH, USDC/WETH) |
| 2000 | 20% | Emerging tokens (new launches, high volatility) |

The tick spacing is displayed in pool names (e.g., "CL1-wstETH/WETH" = tick spacing 1).

## The Unstaked Fee Rake

Slipstream offers LPs the choice between two earning strategies:

### Staked positions
- Earn `AERO` emissions based on veAERO votes
- Forfeit swap fees (100% go to voters)
- Best when emissions APR > fee APR

### Unstaked positions
- Earn **90% of swap fees** directly
- **10% of fees** (the "rake") go to veAERO voters
- Earn **zero emissions**
- Best during high-volatility periods when fees surge above emissions

<Warning>
The 10% unstaked fee rake ensures veAERO voters still benefit from your liquidity even when you're unstaked. This alignment incentivizes voters to vote for your pool.
</Warning>

### When to unstake for fee capture

**Unstake during:**
- High volatility periods when dynamic fees surge
- Temporary market dislocations where fees > emissions
- Short-term liquidity provision (no long-term AERO exposure desired)

**Stake for:**
- Long-term LP positions
- Pools with high veAERO vote allocation
- Consistent emissions > trading fees
- AERO token exposure

The modular MetaDEX architecture allows the unstaked fee rake to be adjusted dynamically to optimize competitiveness while maintaining strong veAERO rewards.

## The Slipstream Advantage

Slipstream outcompetes competitive concentrated liquidity solutions with these integrated features:

### 1. Wider tick spacing
Increased tick spacing means LPs stay in the active tick for longer, significantly increasing rewards over time while reducing management burden.

### 2. Active tick emissions
`AERO` emissions are only streamed to the active tick, rewarding LPs in that range with higher incentives compared to out-of-range positions.

### 3. Dynamic fee optimization
Real-time fee adjustments maximize LP earnings during volatility while maintaining competitive pricing during stable periods.

### 4. Dual earning options
LPs can choose between emissions (staked) or fees (unstaked), optimizing strategy based on current market conditions.

### 5. Modular architecture
Seamless upgrades without disrupting operations—improvements like dynamic fees deployed without requiring liquidity migration.
