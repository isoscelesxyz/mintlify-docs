sidebarTitle: "❓ Providing Liquidity"

Aerodrome is a decentralized exchange, which means that tokens on the platform are not held by a custodial entity like a bank, but rather are deposited by users. Without these liquidity providers (LPs), users would not be able to swap tokens on Aerodrome. In exchange for depositing tokens to facilitate swaps, LPs receive a portion of swap fees when their liquidity is unstaked, or they can take full advantage of the system by staking their liquidity to earn AERO emissions.

## How to provide liquidity

## Important notes

- **Staked liquidity**: If you stake your liquidity you will not earn swap fees and instead will receive `AERO` emissions.
- **Unstaked liquidity**: If you leave your deposit unstaked, you will receive fees. Note that 10% of fees generated by unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible concentrated pools will be taken and distributed as voting rewards.
- **Autopilot**: If you'd like your liquidity management to be "set it and forget it", consider Autopilot.

<Info>
  Choosing between staked and unstaked liquidity depends on your preference: maximize farming rewards (staked) or maximize fee capture (unstaked).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction fails with 'Insufficient liquidity'">
    This usually means the pool doesn't have enough depth for your deposit size. Try reducing the amount or check that you have sufficient token balances.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find the pool I want">
    Not all token pairs have pools. Check if the pool exists by searching both token orders (TOKEN1/TOKEN2 and TOKEN2/TOKEN1). If it doesn't exist, consider creating one or choosing a different pool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High price impact warning">
    Large deposits relative to pool size cause significant price impact. Consider depositing smaller amounts or choosing a pool with deeper liquidity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Position not earning rewards">
    For concentrated pools, verify your position is within the active price range. For staked positions, ensure you've completed the staking step after depositing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't redeem trading fees from my LP position">
    **Cause**: V2 Basic and Stable pools (not CL pools) require fees to be claimed from the gauge after staking.

    **Solution**:

    1. Go to the pool page on Aerodrome
    2. Navigate to your staked position
    3. Look for "Claim Fees" button in the gauge section
    4. Confirm the claim transaction

    CL pools allow fee collection directly from positions without staking.
