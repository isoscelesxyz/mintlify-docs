description: "How to deposit tokens into Aerodrome pools to earn swap fees or AERO emissions"
---

Aerodrome is a decentralized exchange, which means that tokens on the platform are not held by a custodial entity like a bank, but rather are deposited by users. Without these liquidity providers (LPs), users would not be able to swap tokens on Aerodrome.

In exchange for depositing tokens to facilitate swaps, LPs receive a portion of swap fees when their liquidity is unstaked, or they can take full advantage of the system by staking their liquidity to earn `AERO` emissions each week.

## To deposit tokens on Aerodrome:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Connect your wallet by hitting "Connect" in the upper right corner
  </Step>
  <Step>Select "New deposit"</Step>
  <Step>Choose the two tokens you'd like to deposit</Step>
  <Step>
    Select the liquidity pool where you'd like to deposit (you can filter by
    type)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If depositing into a concentrated pool, select the range where your
    liquidity will be active, or select "Autopilot" for automated rebalancing
  </Step>
  <Step>Complete deposit</Step>
  <Step>Choose whether to stake your deposit or leave it unstaked</Step>
  <Step>Go to your dashboard to view all deposits</Step>
</Steps>

## Important notes

- **Staked liquidity**: If you stake your liquidity you will not earn swap fees and instead will receive `AERO` emissions.
- **Unstaked liquidity**: If you leave your deposit unstaked, you will receive fees. Note that 10% of fees generated by unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible concentrated pools will be taken and distributed as voting rewards.
- **Autopilot**: If you'd like your liquidity management to be "set it and forget it", consider Autopilot.

<Info>
  Choosing between staked and unstaked liquidity depends on your preference:
  maximize farming rewards (staked) or maximize fee capture (unstaked).
