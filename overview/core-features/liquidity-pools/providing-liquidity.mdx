sidebarTitle: "Providing Liquidity"
---

Aerodrome is a decentralized exchange, which means that tokens on the platform are not held by a custodial entity like a bank, but rather are deposited by users. Without these liquidity providers (LPs), users would not be able to swap tokens. In exchange for depositing tokens to facilitate swaps, LPs receive a portion of swap fees when their liquidity is unstaked, or they can take full advantage of the MetaDEX model by staking their liquidity to earn AERO emissions.

## How to provide liquidity

<Steps>
  <Step>Connect your wallet by hitting "Connect" in the upper right corner</Step>
  <Step>Visit the [Liquidity](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) page</Step>
  <Step>Select the liquidity pool where you'd like to deposit</Step>
  <Step>
    If depositing into a concentrated pool, select the range where your liquidity will be active, or
    select Autopilot for automated management.
  </Step>
  <Step>Complete the deposit transaction</Step>
  <Step>
    Choose whether to stake your deposit to earn AERO emissions or leave it unstaked to earn swap
    fees
  </Step>
  <Step>Go to your [dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dash) to view all deposits</Step>
</Steps>

## Important notes

- **Staked liquidity**: If you stake your liquidity you will not earn swap fees and instead will receive `AERO` emissions.
- **Unstaked liquidity**: If you leave your deposit unstaked, you will receive fees.<br />
  <Info>
    Note that 10% of fees generated by unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible concentrated pools
    will be taken and distributed as voting rewards.
  </Info>
- **Autopilot**: If you'd like your liquidity management to be "set it and forget it", consider Autopilot.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction fails with 'Insufficient liquidity'">
    This usually means the pool doesn't have enough depth for your deposit size. Try reducing the
    amount or check that you have sufficient token balances.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find the pool I want">
    Not all token pairs have pools. Check if the pool exists by searching both token orders
    (`TOKEN1/TOKEN2` and `TOKEN2/TOKEN1`). You can also search by the token's contract address.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High price impact warning">
    Large deposits relative to pool size cause significant price impact. Consider depositing smaller
    amounts or choosing a pool with deeper liquidity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Position not earning rewards">
    For concentrated pools, verify your position is within the active price range. For staked
    positions, ensure you've completed the staking step after depositing. Both of these will be
    visible in your [dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dash).
