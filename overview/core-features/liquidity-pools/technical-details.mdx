## Mathematical Precision and Pool Mechanics

Aerodrome's liquidity pools operate through precise mathematical calculations that ensure fair pricing and stable operations. The constant product formula <Latex>x × y ≥ k</Latex> and stable curve formula <Latex>x³y + xy³ ≥ k</Latex> maintain pool equilibrium by keeping the constant "k" unchanged regardless of individual trades.

When a user swaps tokens, the pool automatically adjusts token quantities to preserve this mathematical relationship, ensuring that larger trades have proportionally larger price impacts.

**Price Impact Calculation**

Price impact increases quadratically with trade size relative to pool reserves:

<Latex>Price Impact = (Trade Size / Total Pool Liquidity)²</Latex>

Larger pools provide better execution for the same trade size:

<Latex>Slippage = (Expected Price - Actual Price) / Expected Price</Latex>

## Numerical Stability and Precision

Pool contracts handle extreme scenarios and maintain computational accuracy through several mechanisms:

- **Decimal normalization**: Manages tokens with different decimal precisions (6, 18, or custom decimals)
- **Overflow protection**: Safeguards against division-by-zero errors and extreme values
- **Rounding error mitigation**: Prevents precision loss in fee calculations
- **Manipulation resistance**: Computational limits that prevent exploitation through edge cases

## Gas Optimization and Efficiency

Aerodrome's pool contracts are optimized for minimal gas consumption:

- **Batch processing**: Combines multiple operations into single transactions
- **Minimal storage updates**: Carefully managed storage slots reduce expensive SSTORE operations
- **Efficient memory usage**: Optimized for complex calculations
- **Optimized bytecode**: Reduced deployment costs through efficient contract design

## Oracle Functionality and Price Discovery

Every liquidity pool serves as a decentralized price oracle through time-weighted average price (TWAP) calculations. The system stores historical price data at regular intervals, allowing external protocols to access manipulation-resistant price feeds.

<Info>
  This oracle functionality is built into the core pool mechanics, requiring no
  additional infrastructure.

### Oracle Features

- **Automatic TWAP**: Calculation and storage happens on every trade
- **Historical data**: Price retention for multiple time periods
- **Manipulation resistance**: Time-weighting prevents single-block attacks
- **Gas-efficient queries**: Optimized for external protocol integration

## Concentrated Liquidity Technical Implementation

Slipstream's tick system divides the entire price range into discrete intervals, with each tick representing a specific price point. Liquidity providers can concentrate their capital within specific tick ranges, dramatically improving capital efficiency.

### Tick Mechanics

- **Tick spacing**: Determines minimum price movements between ranges
- **Active tracking**: Monitors liquidity at each price level
- **Automatic activation**: Positions activate/deactivate as price moves through ticks
- **Concentration effects**: Precise calculation of capital efficiency gains

## Rebalancing and Arbitrage Mechanics

Pool rebalancing occurs automatically through arbitrage opportunities that emerge when pool prices deviate from external markets. Arbitrageurs profit by trading against pools that offer better prices than the broader market, naturally bringing pool prices back into alignment.

### Rebalancing Process

1. Price deviations create profitable arbitrage opportunities
2. External traders capture these opportunities through swaps
3. Pool ratios automatically adjust to reflect true market prices
4. No manual intervention required for price discovery

## Fee Distribution and Accumulation

Trading fees accumulate within LP positions automatically, compounding returns without requiring manual claiming.

### How fees work by pool type

- **Basic pools**: Fees distributed proportionally to all liquidity providers based on their share of total pool liquidity
- **Slipstream pools**: Fees only earned when positions are within the active trading range, concentrating rewards for active liquidity

### Key mechanics

- Automatic fee compounding within LP token value
- No manual claiming required for fee collection
- Concentrated liquidity earns higher fees per unit of capital when active

This technical foundation ensures that Aerodrome's pools operate efficiently, fairly, and reliably across all market conditions while providing the mathematical guarantees necessary for secure decentralized trading.
