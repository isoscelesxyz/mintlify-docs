description: "How to stake LP tokens and CL positions to earn AERO emissions from gauge rewards"
---

After providing liquidity, you can stake your position to earn <Tooltip tip="Weekly AERO token rewards distributed to liquidity pools based on veAERO votes">`AERO` emissions</Tooltip>. Staking directs your LP tokens or CL position NFTs into <Tooltip tip="Reward distribution contracts that receive AERO emissions based on veAERO votes">gauges</Tooltip>, where they earn rewards based on weekly veAERO voting.

## Before you begin

**Prerequisites**:
- You have already [provided liquidity](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/providing-liquidity) to a pool
- You hold LP tokens (V2 pools) or position NFTs (CL pools)
- The pool has an active gauge (not all pools are eligible for emissions)

<Info>
Not all pools have gauges. Only pools that have been whitelisted and receive veAERO votes earn AERO emissions. Check the pool page to see if staking is available.
</Info>

## Understanding staking

### What happens when you stake

**You earn**:
- ✅ `AERO` emissions based on the pool's share of total votes
- ✅ Rewards accrue continuously throughout the epoch
- ✅ Can claim rewards anytime

**You forfeit**:
- ❌ Trading fees (100% go to veAERO voters for V2 pools)
- ❌ 90% of fees for CL pools (10% still goes to voters, you get zero)

**You can**:
- ✅ Unstake at any time with no penalty
- ✅ Keep earning as long as you stay staked
- ✅ Claim accumulated rewards without unstaking

### Staked vs unstaked decision

<Tip>
Compare "Staked APR" vs "Unstaked APR" on the pool page before staking. Stake when emissions exceed fees.
</Tip>

**Stake when**:
- Pool receives significant veAERO votes (high emissions)
- Emissions APR > fee APR
- You want `AERO` token exposure
- Long-term liquidity provision

**Stay unstaked when**:
- Pool has low or zero votes (minimal emissions)
- Trading fees > potential emissions
- You prefer stable fee income over `AERO`
- CL position is out of range (staking would earn nothing)
- Short-term liquidity provision

## How to stake V2 LP tokens

V2 pools (Basic Pools) use fungible ERC-20 LP tokens that can be staked in gauges.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your pool">
    Go to the [Pools page](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) and find the pool where you provided liquidity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check gauge availability">
    Verify the pool has an active gauge. Look for the "Stake" section on the pool page. If it's not available, the pool cannot receive emissions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter stake amount">
    In the "Stake" section, enter the amount of LP tokens you want to stake. You can click **"Max"** to stake your entire position.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve LP tokens (first time only)">
    If this is your first time staking in this pool, you'll need to approve the gauge contract to spend your LP tokens. Click **"Approve"** and confirm the transaction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stake and confirm">
    Click **"Stake"** and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Once confirmed, your LP tokens are staked and earning emissions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify staking">
    Check your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard) to see your staked position and accumulating `AERO` rewards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
V2 LP token staking is straightforward - you approve once per pool, then stake/unstake as needed. Your LP tokens remain in your control through the gauge contract.
</Info>

## How to stake CL positions (NFTs)

Concentrated liquidity positions are represented as NFTs and have a different staking process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure position is in range">
    CL positions only earn emissions when the active price is within your selected range. Check your position status before staking.

    <Warning>
    Staking an out-of-range CL position earns zero emissions. Wait for price to return to your range or rebalance first.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to your CL position">
    Go to your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard) and find your CL position NFT.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check gauge availability">
    Verify the pool has a CL gauge (CLGauge). Not all CL pools have gauges enabled.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve NFT (first time only)">
    Approve the CLGauge contract to manage your position NFT. Click **"Approve"** and confirm.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stake NFT">
    Click **"Stake"** on your CL position and confirm the transaction. Your NFT is transferred to the gauge contract.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor in-range status">
    Regularly check that your position remains in range. When price moves out of range, you stop earning emissions even while staked.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### CL staking differences

**Key differences from V2 staking**:

| Aspect | V2 LP Tokens | CL Position NFTs |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Token type** | ERC-20 (fungible) | ERC-721 (non-fungible) |
| **Earning condition** | Always (full-range) | Only when in range |
| **Multiple positions** | Combine into one balance | Each NFT staked separately |
| **Contract** | Gauge.sol | CLGauge.sol |
| **Unstaked fees** | 0% (all to voters) | 90% to you, 10% to voters |

<Info>
CL positions require more attention when staked. An out-of-range staked CL position earns nothing, while an unstaked out-of-range position at least earns zero (doesn't forfeit fees you're not earning anyway).
</Info>

## How emissions are calculated

Your `AERO` emissions depend on:

1. **Pool's vote share** - Percentage of total veAERO votes directed to your pool
2. **Weekly emissions** - Total `AERO` distributed that epoch
3. **Your stake share** - Your % of total staked liquidity in the pool
4. **Time in range** (CL only) - Emissions only accrue when position is active

**Formula**:
```
Your Emissions = (Weekly Pool Emissions) × (Your Staked %) × (Time in Range %)
```

**For V2 pools**: Time in Range = 100% (always active)
**For CL pools**: Time in Range = % of epoch your position was in active range

<Tip>
Pools with higher veAERO votes receive more emissions. Check vote allocation on the [Vote page](https://aerodrome.finance/vote) to see which pools are most rewarded.
</Tip>

---

## Claiming staking rewards

Emissions accrue continuously and can be claimed at any time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Visit your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard) to see all claimable rewards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View claimable emissions">
    Each staked position shows accumulated `AERO` emissions. Rewards update in real-time as they accrue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim rewards">
    Click **"Claim"** on individual positions or **"Claim All"** to collect all rewards in one transaction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive AERO">
    `AERO` tokens are sent directly to your wallet. You can swap them, lock them for veAERO, or provide more liquidity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to claim

**Claim frequency considerations**:
- **Gas costs**: Each claim costs gas. Claiming too frequently wastes ETH on fees.
- **Compounding**: More frequent claims allow faster reinvestment
- **Token exposure**: Regular claims reduce `AERO` price risk

**Common strategies**:
- Weekly: Claim at epoch transitions when checking votes
- Bi-weekly: Reduce gas costs while maintaining reasonable compounding
- Monthly: Minimize gas, good for smaller positions
- As needed: Claim when you need the funds

<Tip>
For small positions, claim less frequently to avoid gas costs eating into rewards. For large positions, claim weekly to compound faster.
</Tip>

## How to unstake

Unstaking returns your LP tokens or NFT to your wallet and stops emissions earning.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to staked position">
    Go to your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard) and find your staked position.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter unstake amount">
    For V2 pools, enter the amount of LP tokens to unstake (or click **"Max"**). For CL pools, you unstake the entire NFT position.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Unstake and confirm">
    Click **"Unstake"** and confirm the transaction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim accumulated rewards">
    Before or after unstaking, claim any accumulated emissions. Unstaking does not forfeit earned rewards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive tokens">
    - **V2**: LP tokens returned to your wallet
    - **CL**: Position NFT returned to your wallet
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Unstaking implications

**What happens**:
- ✅ Your LP tokens/NFT returned to your wallet
- ✅ Previously earned emissions remain claimable
- ❌ Stop earning new emissions immediately
- ✅ V2: No fees earned (liquidity still in pool but unstaked)
- ✅ CL: Resume earning 90% of fees (10% still to voters)

**You can**:
- Restake at any time (no penalty)
- Remove liquidity from the pool
- Keep liquidity in pool unstaked (CL pools earn fees this way)

<Warning>
When you unstake V2 LP tokens, you stop earning both emissions and fees until you either restake or remove liquidity. For CL positions, unstaking switches you from emissions to 90% of swap fees.
</Warning>

## Finding pools with gauges

Not all pools have gauges. To find stakeable pools:

### On the Pools page:

1. Look for "Gauge" indicator on pool cards
2. Check "Staked APR" column (if shown, gauge exists)
3. Filter by "Has Gauge" (if available)

### On the Vote page:

1. Visit [Vote page](https://aerodrome.finance/vote)
2. All pools listed have active gauges
3. See current vote allocation and projected emissions

### Pool eligibility:

Pools must be:
- ✅ Whitelisted by governance
- ✅ Created with approved tokens
- ✅ Receiving at least some veAERO votes

**New pools**: May not have gauges immediately. Protocol teams can [incentivize](/overview/core-features/incentivize) to attract votes and emissions.

---

## Maximizing staking rewards

### 1. Choose high-emission pools

Pools with more veAERO votes receive more `AERO` emissions. Check vote allocation to identify high-reward pools.

### 2. For CL: Stay in range

Monitor your CL positions regularly. Out-of-range positions earn zero emissions even when staked. Use [Autopilot](/overview/core-features/autopilot) for automatic range management.

### 3. Compound strategically

Claim and reinvest rewards to compound returns. Options:
- Lock claimed `AERO` for veAERO (earn voting rewards)
- Add to existing LP positions
- Diversify into other pools

### 4. Monitor vote changes

veAERO votes change weekly. A pool with high emissions this week may have low emissions next week. Stay informed about vote dynamics.

### 5. Consider unstaking during volatility

For CL pools during high-volatility periods, unstaking to capture 90% of swap fees may outperform emissions. Check real-time APRs.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My staked position shows zero emissions" icon="circle-question">
    **Common causes**:
    - Pool received zero votes this epoch (check Vote page)
    - CL position is out of range (check position status)
    - Epoch just started (rewards haven't accrued yet)
    - Gauge was recently activated (may take one epoch to start)

    **Solution**:
    - Wait for current epoch to complete
    - Verify pool has votes for this epoch
    - For CL: Rebalance position to get back in range
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't stake my LP tokens" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Pool doesn't have a gauge (not eligible for emissions)
    - Haven't approved the gauge contract yet
    - Insufficient LP token balance

    **Solution**:
    1. Verify pool has gauge (check pool page)
    2. Click "Approve" before staking
    3. Confirm you have LP tokens from providing liquidity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CL position won't stake" icon="nft">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Pool doesn't have CLGauge enabled
    - Haven't approved NFT transfer
    - Position NFT not in your wallet

    **Solution**:
    1. Check if CL pool has gauge (CLGauge)
    2. Approve the CLGauge contract to manage your NFT
    3. Verify NFT ownership in your wallet or Dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I unstake to claim rewards?" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    **No.** You can claim accumulated emissions without unstaking.

    **Process**:
    1. Go to Dashboard
    2. Click "Claim" on your staked position
    3. Emissions sent to wallet
    4. Position remains staked and continues earning

    Only unstake if you want to stop earning emissions or remove liquidity from the pool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost rewards after unstaking?" icon="question">
    **No rewards are lost.** Unstaking does not forfeit previously earned emissions.

    **What happens**:
    - Previously earned rewards remain claimable
    - You stop earning NEW emissions
    - Claim accumulated rewards from your Dashboard

    If you don't see rewards, check:
    - Pool had votes this epoch (zero votes = zero emissions)
    - CL position was in range (out of range = zero earnings)
    - Epoch had enough time to accrue meaningful rewards
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## V2 vs CL staking comparison

| Feature | V2 LP Token Staking | CL Position NFT Staking |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **What you stake** | ERC-20 LP tokens | ERC-721 NFT position |
| **Earning condition** | Always (full-range liquidity) | Only when in active range |
| **Unstaked alternative** | No fees, no emissions | 90% of swap fees |
| **Gauge contract** | Gauge.sol | CLGauge.sol |
| **Flexibility** | Partial stake/unstake | All-or-nothing (entire NFT) |
| **Management** | Passive | Active (monitor range) |
| **Best for** | Passive LPs, stable pairs | Active LPs, volatile pairs |

---

## Advanced staking strategies

### 1. Split staking (V2 pools)

For V2 pools, you can stake only a portion of your LP tokens:
- Stake 70% for emissions
- Keep 30% unstaked for flexibility
- Useful if you might need liquidity soon

### 2. Strategic unstaking (CL pools)

During high-volatility periods when dynamic fees surge:
- Temporarily unstake to capture 90% of fees
- Fees may exceed emissions APR during volatility spikes
- Restake when volatility normalizes

### 3. Multi-pool diversification

Instead of staking everything in one pool:
- Diversify across multiple high-vote pools
- Reduces risk of single pool losing votes
- Balances exposure to different token pairs

### 4. Emissions farming rotation

Follow the votes:
- Provide liquidity to pools receiving high votes this week
- Stake to capture emissions surge
- Monitor vote changes and adjust accordingly
- Higher risk but potentially higher rewards

<Warning>
Advanced strategies require active management and carry additional risks. New users should start with simple, long-term staking in established pools.
</Warning>

## What to do with earned AERO

After claiming staking rewards, consider these options:

### Option 1: Lock for veAERO (recommended for long-term)

[Lock your `AERO`](/overview/core-features/lock) for up to 4 years to receive:
- Voting power to direct future emissions
- 100% of fees from pools you vote for
- Weekly rebases (additional `AERO`)
- Governance participation

### Option 2: Compound into LP positions

Use earned `AERO` to:
- Add to existing liquidity positions
- Create new AERO/WETH or AERO/USDC positions
- Increase earning potential

### Option 3: Swap for stablecoins

Realize profits by swapping `AERO` for USDC or other tokens. Useful for:
- Regular income needs
- Risk management (reduce `AERO` exposure)
- Rebalancing portfolio

### Option 4: Hold AERO

Keep liquid `AERO` in your wallet for:
- Future locking opportunities
- Flexibility to respond to market conditions
- Speculation on `AERO` price appreciation
