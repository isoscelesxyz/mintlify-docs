Put your liquidity on Autopilot and start earning passively. Autopilot is the automated liquidity management solution on Aerodrome, powered by [Mellow](https://mellow.finance).

Using Mellow vaults and strategies, Autopilot manages liquidity ranges, automatically rebalances positions, and compounds returns for liquidity providers. Simply select an Autopilot-enabled pool, deposit your liquidity, and enjoy steady rewards with fully automated management.

## What is Autopilot?

Autopilot provides **100% passive, onchain, and non-custodial** automated liquidity management for <Tooltip tip="Concentrated liquidity pools with customizable price ranges and dynamic fees">Slipstream</Tooltip> concentrated liquidity pools.

Without automated liquidity management (ALM), liquidity providers must manually adjust their <Tooltip tip="Concentrated liquidity pool positions represented as NFTs">CL positions</Tooltip> to stay within profitable price ranges. Autopilot handles this rebalancing automatically based on market conditions and historical performance, helping to mitigate <Tooltip tip="The difference in value between holding tokens versus providing liquidity">impermanent loss</Tooltip> through active range management.

## How Autopilot works

### Continuous monitoring

Autopilot vaults monitor pool price movements in real-time, tracking when positions move near the edge of their active ranges.

### Automatic rebalancing

When the price moves out of range or approaches range boundaries, Autopilot automatically:

1. Removes liquidity from the current position
2. Calculates optimal new range based on volatility and market depth
3. Re-deposits liquidity in the updated range
4. Stakes the position to earn <Tooltip tip="Weekly AERO token rewards distributed to liquidity pools based on veAERO votes">emissions</Tooltip>

### Batched operations

Autopilot batches multiple user positions together for rebalancing, significantly reducing gas costs per user compared to manual management.

### Fee optimization

Autopilot positions capture swap fees and `AERO` emissions while in range. The automation ensures positions stay active during high-volume periods when fees are most profitable.

## Fee structure

Autopilot is **100% free** to use with **zero management fees**.

**What you earn:**

- 100% of swap fees from your position
- 100% of `AERO` emissions from gauge staking
- Reduced gas costs through batched rebalancing

**What you pay:**

- No management fees
- No performance fees
- Only standard network gas costs for deposits and withdrawals

## When to use Autopilot

### Use Autopilot when:

✅ **You want passive CL exposure** - No need to monitor price movements or rebalance manually

✅ **Pool has high volatility** - Frequent price swings require regular rebalancing to stay in range

✅ **You're new to concentrated liquidity** - Automated management removes the complexity of range selection

✅ **Gas costs are high** - Batched operations reduce rebalancing costs significantly

✅ **Time constraints** - You can't actively manage positions daily

### Use manual CL when:

❌ **You have strong conviction on price range** - Specific range strategy you want to maintain

❌ **Pool is very stable** - Minimal rebalancing needed (e.g., stablecoin pairs)

❌ **You want maximum control** - Precise control over position parameters and timing

❌ **You can monitor regularly** - Able to rebalance manually when needed

<Tip>
  For most users, Autopilot vaults offer a simpler way to earn from concentrated liquidity without
  the complexity of manual position management.

## Getting started with Autopilot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an Autopilot vault">
    Visit the [Pools page](https://aerodrome.finance/pools) and filter for Autopilot vaults. These are marked with an "Autopilot" badge.
  </Step>

<Step title="Deposit liquidity">
  Select your desired Autopilot vault and deposit both tokens in the required ratio. The vault will
  automatically create and manage the CL position.
</Step>

<Step title="Receive vault tokens">
  You'll receive ERC-20 vault tokens representing your share of the Autopilot vault. These tokens
  can be staked to earn additional `AERO` emissions.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor performance">
  Track your vault's performance through the Aerodrome UI. Autopilot will handle all rebalancing
  automatically.
</Step>

  <Step title="Withdraw when ready">
    Withdraw from the vault at any time. You'll receive the underlying tokens based on your vault token balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How rebalancing works

When Autopilot rebalances your position:

1. **Trigger conditions** - Price approaches range boundary or moves out of range
2. **Position closure** - Current CL position liquidity is removed
3. **New range calculation** - Algorithm determines optimal new range based on:
   - Current price
   - Recent volatility
   - Liquidity distribution
   - Historical pool data
4. **Position creation** - New CL position opened with updated range
5. **Auto-staking** - Position automatically staked in gauge for emissions

<Warning>
  During rebalancing, there may be brief periods where your position is not earning fees. Autopilot
  minimizes this downtime, but it's a normal part of automated management.
</Warning>

## Understanding Autopilot performance

### What affects returns

**Positive factors:**

- High trading volume = more swap fees
- veAERO votes to your pool = higher emissions
- Efficient rebalancing = more time in range
- Lower gas costs through batching

**Costs to consider:**

- Impermanent loss (same as manual CL)
- Gas costs for deposits/withdrawals
- Brief downtime during rebalances

### Comparing to alternatives

**Autopilot vs Basic Pools (V2)**:

- ✅ Higher capital efficiency when in range
- ❌ More complex, requires rebalancing
- ✅ Automated management removes manual work

**Autopilot vs Manual CL**:

- ✅ Lower gas costs (batched rebalancing)
- ✅ Automated optimization
- ✅ Zero management fees
- ❌ Less control over exact ranges

<Tip>
  Check the vault's historical APR on the Aerodrome app to see net returns after fees and gas costs.
</Tip>

## Risk considerations

<Warning>
Autopilot does not eliminate concentrated liquidity risks. You are still exposed to:

- **Impermanent loss** - Price divergence between tokens affects your position value
- **Range risk** - Even with rebalancing, extreme volatility can cause losses
- **Smart contract risk** - Both Aerodrome and Mellow contracts

See [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin) for general DeFi risks.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why should I use Autopilot instead of managing my liquidity?">
    Autopilot removes the complexity and time commitment of managing concentrated liquidity positions. Instead of monitoring price movements and manually rebalancing your position when it goes out of range, Autopilot handles this automatically. This is especially valuable for volatile pairs that require frequent rebalancing, or if you don't have time to actively manage positions daily. Batched rebalancing also reduces gas costs significantly compared to manual management.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is my liquidity managed?">
  Autopilot uses Mellow vaults that continuously monitor your pool's price movements. When the price
  approaches or moves outside your position's range, the vault automatically removes liquidity,
  calculates an optimal new range based on volatility and market depth, and re-deposits liquidity in
  the updated range. The position is then automatically staked to earn `AERO` emissions. All
  operations are batched with other users to minimize gas costs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do rewards work with Autopilot?">
  Your Autopilot position earns both swap fees from trading activity and `AERO` emissions from gauge
  staking. When you deposit into an Autopilot vault, you receive ERC-20 vault tokens representing
  your share. These vault tokens can be staked to earn additional `AERO` emissions. The vault
  automatically compounds returns by reinvesting earned fees back into the position during
  rebalancing operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any fees or costs associated with Autopilot?">
  Autopilot is completely free to use with zero management fees or performance fees. You keep 100%
  of all swap fees and `AERO` emissions earned by your position. The only costs are standard network
  gas fees for deposits and withdrawals, which are minimized through batched rebalancing operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Autopilot available for all pools?">
  Autopilot is available for select Slipstream (concentrated liquidity) pools on Aerodrome. You can
  find Autopilot-enabled pools by visiting the [Pools page](https://aerodrome.finance/pools) and
  filtering for pools with the "Autopilot" badge. The availability depends on Mellow vault
  deployments for specific pool pairs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the risks of using Autopilot?">
  Autopilot does not eliminate the fundamental risks of concentrated liquidity provision. You are
  still exposed to impermanent loss when token prices diverge, range risk during extreme volatility,
  and smart contract risk from both Aerodrome and Mellow contracts. During rebalancing operations,
  there may be brief periods where your position is not actively earning fees. See the Risk
  Considerations section above for more details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Aerodrome manage the liquidity in Autopilot?">
  No, Aerodrome does not manage Autopilot liquidity. Autopilot is powered by Mellow (Mellow
  Finance), an independent automated liquidity management provider. Mellow's vaults and strategies
  handle all rebalancing, range optimization, and position management. Aerodrome provides the
  underlying Slipstream pools where the liquidity is deployed, but the automation layer is entirely
  managed by Mellow.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Autopilot audited?">
    Autopilot uses Mellow's audited smart contracts for vault management. For specific audit reports and security information about Mellow, visit [mellow.finance](https://mellow.finance). As with all DeFi protocols, you should review the audit reports and understand that audits do not eliminate all smart contract risks.
