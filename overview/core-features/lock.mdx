This guide is for AERO holders who want to participate in governance and earn protocol revenue. You will learn how to lock `AERO` tokens to create veAERO, enabling you to vote on emissions, earn protocol revenue, and participate in Aerodrome governance.

<Warning>
Locked `AERO` cannot be unlocked early. Once you lock your tokens for a duration (minimum 1 week, maximum 4 years), they remain locked until the expiry date. You can extend your lock duration but never reduce it. Consider your liquidity needs before locking.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

You'll need:
- A Web3 wallet connected to Base (see [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin))
- `AERO` tokens in your wallet
- ETH on Base for gas fees
- Understanding of vote-locking mechanics and risks

## How locking works

Each week, Aerodrome distributes 100% of protocol revenue (swap fees + voting incentives) to <Tooltip tip="Vote-escrowed AERO - locked AERO tokens that grant governance rights">veAERO</Tooltip> voters. When you lock `AERO`, you receive a veAERO position that grants voting power. Your voting power increases proportionally with lock duration, reaching maximum power at four years.

<Info>
  veAERO is implemented as an NFT (non-fungible token), allowing you to transfer
  or manage your locked position separately from your wallet's other assets.

## Lock `AERO` tokens

<Steps>

<Step title="Acquire `AERO` tokens">
  Hold or acquire `AERO` by
  [swapping](/overview/core-features/swap) directly for `AERO`
  or [receiving `AERO` emissions](/overview/core-features/rewards) as a
  liquidity provider.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your wallet">
  Connect your wallet by clicking "Connect" in the upper right corner of the
  Aerodrome interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Create lock">
  Click "Create Lock" to begin the locking process.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock amount">
  Choose the amount of `AERO` you want to lock. This amount will be locked for
  the duration you select.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock duration">
  Choose your lock duration. Locks can be extended but never decreased. Your
  voting power increases proportionally with duration, with maximum voting power
  achieved at four years.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm lock creation">
  Confirm the transaction in your wallet and verify your lock appears under
  "Locks" in your dashboard.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
  After confirming your lock, you may see an `"insufficient balance"` message.
  This message appears because your `AERO` tokens are now locked and no longer
  available in your wallet balance.
</Tip>

## Optimize with Relays

After creating your lock, you can deposit your veAERO into a <Tooltip tip="Automated liquidity management and voting optimization tool">Relay</Tooltip>. Relays automate weekly voting to optimize your rewards and maintain your lock at the maximum duration of four years.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I unlock my AERO early?">
    No. Locked `AERO` cannot be unlocked before the expiry date. This is a core design feature of the veAERO system. Plan your lock duration carefully based on your liquidity needs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My lock expired - what happens now?">
    When your lock expires, your veAERO voting power drops to zero but your `AERO` remains locked. You can either unlock and withdraw your `AERO` or extend your lock to restore voting power.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I transfer my veAERO NFT?">
    Yes. veAERO is implemented as an NFT, so you can transfer it to another wallet or sell it. The new holder will have the voting rights and receive rewards for that position.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add more AERO to an existing lock?">
    No. Each lock is a separate veAERO NFT position. To lock more `AERO`, create a new lock. You can manage multiple locks simultaneously.
