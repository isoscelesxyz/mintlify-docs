**Relay** simplifies the management of **veAERO** positions. It automates weekly voting and rewards claiming.

**Core functions:**

- **Auto Max-Lock:** veAERO is automatically set to Auto Max-Lock
- **Automatic voting:** Votes are cast automatically each week
- **Rebasing:** Rebases are autocompounded back into underlying position
- **Rewards:** Handled according to chosen strategy

**Relay Strategy Types**

**Compounders**

Compounders are designed for users who want to increase their voting power. They automatically claim all rebases and rewards and compound them into veAERO, increasing the underlying locked position. The compounder voting strategy is designed to maximize rewards by dollar value.

**Convertors**

Convertors are designed to generate liquid yield while maintaining veAERO positions. While rebases are still compounded back into your veNFT, all other rewards are converted into an asset specified by the Relay (eg. USDC, OP, ETH) and are then made claimable each week. Converter voting strategy may include voting for strategic pools that contain specific assets.

<Info>
Withdrawal of veNFTs is possible only after the first week. Always make sure the automation was run before any withdrawal.

**Protocol-Run Relays**

The **veAERO MAXI Relay** uses a compounder strategy with these functions:

- **Voting:** Votes to optimally achieve maximum rewards available
- **Rebasing:** Claims the rebase
- **Rewards conversion:** Claims & converts rewards into AERO
- **Locking:** Locks all converted AERO, increasing the locked amount of those who deposited into the Relay

**Partner Relays**

These Relay strategies are run by or for protocol partners, usually other protocols with the goal of supporting specific liquidity pools.

These strategies generally vote to support their own liquidity and thus those who deposit into those pools. In comparison to the veAERO Maxi, these relays will likely achieve smaller but more consistent rewards for their pools.

Partner protocols can request a Relay strategy. This may soon require an open governance proposal to be voted and passed by veAERO voters.

**Architecture**

Relay strategies are simple smart contracts that operate a specially managed **veNFT**, also known as **(m)veNFT**.

The **(m)veNFTs** can be minted or deactivated by the protocol Governor and carry no voting power initially. Instead, these aggregate the voting power of any regular deposited veNFTs. Once withdrawn, the regular veNFTs receive a share of the aggregated voting power and the unlock date is set to maximum.

Owners of these (m)veNFTs can vote, claim rebases, and collect rewards. That is why these are usually granted to protocols or managers of the Relay strategies.

In case of an issue with one of the (m)veNFTs, these get deactivated and the depositors will have to withdraw safely their veNFTs.

Relay was designed to solve the partner protocol needs and provide a flexible way to build strategies on top of (m)veNFTs. Relay strategies are automated and operated by a decentralized network, with the exception of the voting, which is handled by the (m)veNFT managers.

**Governance**

Depositors are still able to exercise their governance voting power. The Governor will report the up-to-date locked amount of the veNFTs managed by a Relay strategy.
