In this guide, you will learn how to vote with veAERO to direct `AERO` emissions to liquidity pools and earn protocol revenue. This guide is for veAERO holders who want to participate in governance and earn voting rewards.

## How voting works

Each week, veAERO holders vote to direct `AERO` emissions to liquidity pools. In exchange, voters for each pool share:

- Swap fees generated by staked liquidity in that pool
- 10% of fees from unstaked concentrated liquidity
- Voting incentives (bribes)

Votes for each epoch are due by **Wednesday at 23:00 UTC**, 1 hour before the next epoch begins. The two hours after the vote closes are reserved for protocol operations and automations.

<Warning>
  Your votes automatically carry over to the next epoch unless you change them. You cannot unlock
  your veAERO during any epoch in which it has active votes.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

- You must have a veAERO lock. If you don't have one yet, see [How to lock](/overview/core-features/lock).
- Your wallet must be connected to the Aerodrome interface on Base.

## How to vote

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the vote screen">
    Go to the [Vote page](https://aerodrome.finance/vote) on Aerodrome Finance.
  </Step>

<Step title="Find pools to vote for">
  Identify pools where you would like to cast your vote using the sort function or by searching for
  token symbol or address.
</Step>

<Step title="Select pools">
  On the pool you'd like to vote for, click **Select** in the bottom-right corner and choose which
  lock you want to vote with (if you have multiple locks).
</Step>

  <Step title="Allocate voting power">
    Divide your vote as a percentage across the pools you've selected. Use the arrows on the side of the percentage field to adjust by increments of 5%.

    Unallocated vote-power (if < 100%) will be split proportionally among the selected pools. Each veAERO lock can only cast votes once per epoch.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit your votes">
    Once 100% of your votes have been allocated, select **Vote** for each lock and approve the transaction in your wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If you increased your veAERO balance during the epoch, recast your vote to allocate your full
  voting power. Unchanged votes automatically carry over to the next epoch.
</Info>

<Tip>
  For a more automated voting experience, you can deposit your lock into a Relay. [Learn more about
  Relays](/overview/core-features/relay).
</Tip>

## Claiming rewards

Voting rewards for a given epoch appear in your Dashboard after the epoch change on Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Rebase rewards for new locks appear after the second epoch change.

Visit your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard) to claim accumulated rewards.

## Understanding vAPR

vAPR (voting APR) represents the estimated annual percentage return from voting with your veAERO, based on:

- Historical swap fees from the pool
- Voting incentives (bribes) offered for the current epoch
- Your voting power relative to total votes on that gauge

vAPR is an estimate and actual returns will vary based on trading volume, liquidity depth, and vote distribution.
