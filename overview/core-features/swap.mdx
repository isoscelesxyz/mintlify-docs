In this guide, you will learn how to swap tokens on Aerodrome. This guide is for anyone who wants to exchange tokens on Base using Aerodrome's liquidity pools.

## How it works

Aerodrome enables token swaps by routing trades through liquidity pools. Due to deep liquidity and efficient routing, swaps typically experience low fees and minimal <Tooltip tip="The difference between the quoted price and the actual executed price due to market movements or liquidity depth">slippage</Tooltip>.

<Warning>
Large swaps in low-liquidity pools can result in high slippage and price impact. Always review the quote and price impact before confirming your swap.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

- You need a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Rainbow) connected to Base
- You need the tokens you want to swap, plus ETH for gas fees
- Ensure you understand slippage tolerance and price impact

## How to swap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    Click **Connect** in the upper right corner of [Aerodrome Finance](https://aerodrome.finance/swap) and select your wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select tokens">
    In the **Sell** field, select the token you want to swap from.

    In the **Buy** field, select the token you want to receive.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter amount">
    Input the amount you'd like to trade in either the Sell or Buy field. The other field will automatically calculate based on the current exchange rate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the quote">
    Review the exchange rate, fees, and slippage tolerance. Check the price impact percentage to ensure it's acceptable.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve tokens (if needed)">
    If this is your first time swapping this token, you'll need to approve the contract to spend your tokens. Click **Approve** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the swap">
    Click **Swap** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Swap fails or won't execute">
    If your swap doesn't execute, try increasing your slippage tolerance. Assets experiencing volatile price swings may require higher slippage settings.

    To adjust slippage: Click the settings icon and increase the slippage tolerance percentage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a token">
    If you cannot locate a token by searching for the ticker symbol, try searching by the contract address instead.

    You can find verified contract addresses on [Aerodrome's security page](/overview/security/contract-addresses) or on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High slippage warning">
    High slippage warnings typically occur when:
    - The pool has low liquidity for the tokens you're swapping
    - You're swapping a large amount relative to pool size
    - The token price is highly volatile

    Consider reducing your swap size or checking if there are alternative routes with better liquidity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For large swaps, consider splitting them into smaller trades to reduce price impact and slippage.
