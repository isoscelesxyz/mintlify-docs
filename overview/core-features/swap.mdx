As the essential trading hub of Base, Aerodrome is the exchange of choice for users who want to swap tokens on the network. Due to Aerodrome's deep liquidity and innovative mechanics, users typically experience low swap fees and minimal <Tooltip tip="The difference between the quoted price and the actual executed price due to market movements or liquidity depth">slippage</Tooltip> when exchanging tokens.

## How to swap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    Visit the [Swap page](https://aerodrome.finance/swap) and click "Connect" in the upper right corner to connect your wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select tokens">
    In the **Sell** field, select the token you want to swap from.

    In the **Buy** field, select the token you want to receive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter amount">
    Input the amount you'd like to trade in either the Sell or Buy field. The other field will automatically calculate based on the current exchange rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the quote">
    Review the exchange rate, fees, and slippage tolerance. Check the price impact percentage to ensure it's acceptable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve tokens (if needed)">
    If this is your first time swapping this token, you'll need to approve the contract to spend your tokens. Click **Approve** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

    _This is giving permission to the contract to spend your tokens on your behalf for the amount you've chosen in order to make the swap._
  </Step>
  <Step title="View confirmation">
    After the transaction completes, you can view the receipt by clicking **View confirmation**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How routing works

Aerodrome automatically finds the optimal path for your swap, even when a direct pool doesn't exist.

The interface evaluates potential routes by:

1. **Discovering paths** - Finding all possible routes up to 3 hops, prioritizing high-liquidity connector tokens (USDC, WETH, AERO)
2. **Fetching quotes** - Querying on-chain quoter contracts for each potential route
3. **Comparing outputs** - Selecting the route that returns the most tokens after fees and price impact
4. **Mixing pool types** - Routes can combine Basic, Stable, and CL pools for optimal pricing

The interface selects the path with the **best net output** and submits it to the Universal Router for execution.

### Route examples

**Single-hop (direct)**:
```
USDC → [USDC/WETH pool] → WETH
```

**Multi-hop (indirect)**:
```
RARE_TOKEN → [RARE_TOKEN/WETH pool] → WETH → [WETH/USDC pool] → USDC
```

**Mixed pool types**:
```
TOKEN_A → [Basic pool] → WETH → [CL pool] → USDC
```

<Info>
  The UI displays the route before you confirm. You'll see something like "USDC → WETH → AERO"
  showing the path your swap will take.

## Fees

### Basic pool fees

Basic pools have fixed fees:

| Pool Type | Fee   |
| --------- | ----- |
| Stable    | 0.05% |
| Volatile  | 0.30% |

The protocol can set custom fees (0-3%) for specific pools.

### CL pool fees

Slipstream concentrated liquidity pools have fees based on tick spacing:

| Tick Spacing | Fee    | Typical Use Case                    |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1            | 0.01%  | Highly correlated (LSTs, wrappers)  |
| 10           | 0.05%  | Stable pairs                        |
| 50           | 0.05%  | Stable pairs                        |
| 100          | 0.05%  | Correlated volatile pairs           |
| 200          | 0.30%  | Standard volatile pairs             |
| 2000         | 1.00%  | Exotic/low-liquidity pairs          |

The protocol can set custom fees (up to 3%) for specific pools.

### Total swap cost

Your total cost includes:

1. **Pool fees** - 0.01% to 1% depending on pool type
2. **Price impact** - Depends on trade size vs liquidity
3. **Gas fees** - ~$0.05-0.30 on Base

## Slippage and price impact

<Warning>
  Large swaps in low-liquidity pools can result in high slippage and price impact. Always review the
  quote and price impact before confirming your swap.
</Warning>

### Slippage tolerance

<Tooltip tip="The difference between the quoted price and the actual executed price">Slippage</Tooltip> occurs when the price changes between when you submit a transaction and when it's executed onchain. **Slippage tolerance** is the maximum price movement you'll accept:

- **Default**: 0.5% (suitable for most swaps)
- **Stable pairs**: Can use 0.1-0.3%
- **Low liquidity pools**: May need 1-2%
- **Volatile tokens**: May need 3-5%

<Warning>
  Setting slippage too high (>5%) exposes you to <Tooltip tip="Maximal Extractable Value - bots that extract value by front-running your transaction">MEV</Tooltip> attacks and poor execution. Only increase when necessary.
</Warning>

### Price impact

Price impact shows how much your trade will move the market price:

- **Less than 0.5%**: Normal for most trades
- **0.5-1%**: Acceptable for medium trades
- **Greater than 1%**: Consider splitting into smaller trades
- **Greater than 5%**: Trade size too large for pool liquidity

### Large trades

For trades >$10,000, consider splitting across time to reduce price impact and MEV exposure. Execute 25% of the trade, wait 5-10 minutes, then repeat.

For very large trades (>$100k), consider OTC negotiation with LPs or protocols. Contact via [Discord](https://discord.gg/aerodrome) for coordination.

<Tip>
  For swaps >1% of pool TVL, expect noticeable price impact. Check the pool's TVL on the Pools page before large swaps.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed: 'Insufficient allowance'">
    **Cause**: You haven't approved the token for the Aerodrome router.

    **Solution**:

    1. Click **"Approve [TOKEN]"** button
    2. Confirm approval transaction in wallet
    3. Wait for confirmation
    4. Retry swap

    <Info>
      Approvals are one-time per token. After approving once, you won't need to approve again for that token.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed: 'Transaction deadline exceeded'">
    **Cause**: Transaction took too long to process (default 30-minute deadline).

    **Solution**:

    - Retry the swap with current prices
    - Increase deadline in swap settings if network is congested
    - Check Base network status for issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High slippage warning">
    **Cause**: Low pool liquidity or large trade size relative to available liquidity.

    **Solution**:

    - **Reduce trade amount** to lower price impact
    - **Increase slippage tolerance** carefully (be aware of MEV risks)
    - **Split into multiple trades** over time
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find a token">
    **Cause**: Token not in default list or misspelled ticker.

    **Solution**:

    1. Click token selector dropdown
    2. Paste token **contract address** directly
    3. Verify address from official sources
    4. Token appears if it exists on Base

    <Warning>
      Always verify contract addresses from official project sources. Scam tokens with similar names exist.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Swap quote seems wrong or outdated">
    **Cause**: Prices moved since quote was generated, or pool liquidity changed.

    **Solution**:

    - Refresh the swap page
    - Re-enter amounts to get fresh quote
    - Check if you're comparing against different pools/CEXs (prices vary)
    - Verify you're looking at the correct token (many have similar names)
  </Accordion>
