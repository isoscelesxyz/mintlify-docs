Each week, Aerodrome distributes 100% of the prior week's revenue to voters. To become a voter, you must first "lock" AERO to create a veAERO NFT (non-fungible token). Your veAERO gives you the ability to direct newly minted AERO tokens to liquidity pools which are then distributed to the LPs who have deposited liquidity in those pools. The fees that have accrued for that pool, along with any additional incentives (tokens deposited to help steer votes to specific pools), are then shared among the veAERO holders who voted for the pool.

To lock AERO on Aerodrome:

1. Hold or acquire AERO: you can either swap directly for AERO or can receive AERO emissions as a liquidity provider
2. Connect your wallet by hitting "Connect" in the upper right corner
3. Tap "Create Lock"
4. Select the amount of AERO you'd like to lock
5. Select the amount of time you'd like to lock for. Locks can be extended but never decreased. Your voting power increases proportionally with the duration of your lock, with the maximum voting power achieved at four years.
6. Go to your dashboard and confirm your lock appears under "Locks"
7. From here, you can deposit your veAERO NFT into a Relay, a feature that automates weekly voting to optimize your rewards and maintains your lock at the maximum duration of four years. You can learn more about Relays here

Tips:

- After confirming your lock, you may see an "insufficient balance" message. This simply indicates your AERO tokens have been successfully locked and are no longer available in your wallet.
