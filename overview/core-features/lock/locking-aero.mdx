---

Each week, Aerodrome distributes 100% of the prior week's revenue to voters. To become a voter, you must first "lock" `AERO` to create a veAERO NFT (non-fungible token).

Your veAERO gives you the ability to:
- Direct newly minted `AERO` tokens to liquidity pools
- Receive a share of fees and incentives from pools you vote for
- Participate in protocol governance

The fees that have accrued for each pool, along with any additional incentives (tokens deposited to help steer votes to specific pools), are then shared among the veAERO holders who voted for that pool.

## To lock `AERO` on Aerodrome:

1. **Acquire `AERO`**: You can either swap directly for `AERO` or receive `AERO` emissions as a liquidity provider
2. **Connect your wallet**: Hit "Connect" in the upper right corner
3. **Tap "Create Lock"**: Begin the locking process
4. **Select lock amount**: Choose the amount of `AERO` you'd like to lock
5. **Select lock duration**: Choose the duration. Locks can be extended but never decreased. Your voting power increases proportionally with duration, with maximum voting power achieved at four years.
6. **Confirm your lock**: Go to your dashboard and verify your lock appears under "Locks"
7. **Optional - Use Relays**: Deposit your veAERO NFT into a Relay to automate weekly voting and maintain your lock at the maximum duration of four years.

**Important note:**

After confirming your lock, you may see an "insufficient balance" message. This simply indicates your `AERO` tokens have been successfully locked and are no longer available in your wallet.

<Tip>
For passive reward optimization without manual weekly voting, consider using a Relay to automate your voting strategy.
