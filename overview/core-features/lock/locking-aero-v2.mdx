You will learn how to lock AERO tokens to create veAERO, enabling you to vote on emissions, earn protocol revenue, and participate in Aerodrome governance.

## How locking works

Each week, Aerodrome distributes 100% of the prior week's revenue to voters. When you lock AERO, you receive a veAERO position that grants voting power. Your voting power increases proportionally with lock duration, reaching maximum power at four years.

<Info>
veAERO is implemented as an NFT (non-fungible token), allowing you to transfer or manage your locked position separately from your wallet's other assets.

## Lock AERO tokens

<Steps>

<Step title="Acquire AERO tokens">
Hold or acquire AERO by swapping directly for AERO or receiving AERO emissions as a liquidity provider.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your wallet">
Connect your wallet by clicking "Connect" in the upper right corner of the Aerodrome interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Create lock">
Click "Create Lock" to begin the locking process.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock amount">
Choose the amount of AERO you want to lock. This amount will be locked for the duration you select.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock duration">
Choose your lock duration. Locks can be extended but never decreased. Your voting power increases proportionally with duration, with maximum voting power achieved at four years.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm lock creation">
Confirm the transaction in your wallet and verify your lock appears under "Locks" in your dashboard.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
After confirming your lock, you may see an `"insufficient balance"` message. This message appears because your AERO tokens are now locked and no longer available in your wallet balance.

## Optimize with Relays

After creating your lock, you can deposit your veAERO into a [Relay](/overview/core-features/relay/relay). Relays automate weekly voting to optimize your rewards and maintain your lock at the maximum duration of four years.
