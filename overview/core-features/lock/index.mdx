This guide is for `AERO` holders who want to vote on emissions and earn protocol revenue. You will learn how to lock `AERO` tokens to create veAERO, enabling you to vote on emissions and earn protocol revenue.

<Warning>
  Locked `AERO` cannot be unlocked early. Once you lock your tokens for a duration (minimum 1 week,
  maximum 4 years), they remain locked until the expiry date. You can extend your lock duration but
  never reduce it. Consider your liquidity needs before locking.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

You'll need:

- A Web3 wallet connected to Base (see [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin))
- `AERO` tokens in your wallet
- ETH on Base for gas fees
- Understanding of vote-locking mechanics and risks

## How locking works

Each week, Aerodrome distributes 100% of protocol revenue (swap fees + voting incentives) to <Tooltip tip="Vote-escrowed AERO - locked AERO tokens that grant voting power">veAERO</Tooltip> voters. When you lock `AERO`, you receive a veAERO position that grants voting power. Your voting power increases proportionally with lock duration, reaching maximum power at four years.

<Tip>
  **Transferable advantage**: Unlike some ve-tokenomics models (e.g., Curve's veCRV), veAERO
  positions are ERC-721 NFTs that you can sell or trade on secondary markets, providing liquidity
  even while locked.
</Tip>

## Lock `AERO` tokens

<Steps>

<Step title="Acquire `AERO` tokens">
  Hold or acquire `AERO` by [swapping](/overview/core-features/swap) directly for `AERO` or
  [receiving `AERO` emissions](/overview/core-features/rewards) as a liquidity provider.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your wallet">
  Connect your wallet by clicking "Connect" in the upper right corner of the Aerodrome interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Create lock">
  Visit the [Lock page](https://aerodrome.finance/lock) and click "Create Lock" to begin the locking
  process.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock amount">
  Choose the amount of `AERO` you want to lock. This amount will be locked for the duration you
  select.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock duration">
  Choose your lock duration. Locks can be extended but never decreased. Your voting power increases
  proportionally with duration, with maximum voting power achieved at four years.

</Step>

<Step title="Confirm lock creation">
  Confirm the transaction in your wallet and verify your lock appears under "Locks" in your
  [dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dash).
</Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
  After confirming your lock, you may see an `"insufficient balance"` message. This message appears
  because your `AERO` tokens are now locked and no longer available in your wallet balance.
</Tip>

## Managing your lock

After creating your lock, you can modify it in several ways:

### Increase lock amount

Increase the amount of `AERO` in an existing lock to boost your voting power immediately without changing your lock duration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your lock">
  Navigate to your veAERO position in the Locks dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Increase amount">
  Click "Increase Amount" and enter the additional `AERO` you want to add.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm transaction">
  Your voting power increases immediately while your lock expiry date remains unchanged.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Extend duration

Extend your lock expiry date to increase your voting power. You can extend at any time, even before your current lock expires.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your lock">
  Navigate to your veAERO position in the Locks dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Extend duration">
  Click "Extend Lock" and select a new expiry date (must be later than current expiry, up to 4 years
  from now).
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm transaction">
  Your voting power increases based on the new duration. You cannot shorten a lock duration, only extend it.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Poke

If you've increased your lock amount or extended your duration after voting, use "Poke" to sync your new voting power with your existing votes.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your lock">
  Go to your veAERO position in the Locks dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Poke">
  Click "Poke" to update your voting power across all pools you've voted for this epoch.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Poke is only needed if you've modified your lock after voting. Your votes carry over each epoch
  automatically—you only need to vote again if you want to change your allocation.
</Info>

### Reset

Clear your votes from the previous epoch to reallocate your voting power to different pools.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your lock">
  Go to your veAERO position in the Locks dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Reset">
  Click "Reset" to clear your vote allocation. This is only available if you haven't voted in the
  current epoch yet.
</Step>

<Step title="Vote on new pools">
  After resetting, you can allocate your voting power to different pools.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Reset is only available between epochs if you haven't voted yet in the current epoch. If you've
  already voted this epoch, you cannot reset until the next epoch begins.
</Info>

### Merge

Combine multiple veNFT positions into a single position to consolidate voting power and simplify management.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select source positions">
  Navigate to your Locks dashboard and identify the veNFTs you want to merge. You must own all positions.
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate merge">
  Select the veNFT you want to merge into (the "destination") and the veNFT(s) you want to merge
  from (the "source").
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm transaction">
  Review the resulting position details. The lock duration is a **weighted average** based on the amount of `AERO` and remaining lock time in each position. Once confirmed, source veNFTs are permanently burned.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Merging veNFTs is **irreversible**. Source veNFTs are burned permanently and cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

### Transfer

veAERO positions are ERC-721 NFTs that can be transferred to another wallet or sold on secondary markets.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your lock">
  Navigate to the veNFT you want to transfer in your Locks dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter recipient address">
  Click "Transfer" and enter the wallet address of the recipient.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm transaction">
  The recipient receives full control of the veNFT, including voting rights and future rewards.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  veNFTs often trade at a discount to underlying `AERO` value on secondary markets. Discount
  increases as lock expiry approaches.
</Info>

### Auto max-lock

Enable permanent maximum voting power by locking your `AERO` indefinitely.

A permanent lock:

- Maintains **maximum voting power** (equivalent to a 4-year lock) indefinitely
- **Never decays** - voting power remains constant
- **Cannot be unlocked** - the `AERO` is locked forever
- Can only be exited by selling or transferring the veNFT

<Steps>
<Step title="Select position">
  Navigate to the veNFT you want to convert to a permanent lock.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable permanent lock">
  Click "Enable Permanent Lock" and carefully review the warning.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm transaction">
  Your veNFT now has permanent maximum voting power and can never be unlocked.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Permanent locks are **completely irreversible**. Your `AERO` will be locked forever. The only way
  to exit is to sell or transfer the veNFT on secondary markets.
</Warning>

## Optimize with Relays

After creating your lock, you can deposit your veAERO into a <Tooltip tip="Automated liquidity management and voting optimization tool">Relay</Tooltip>. Relays automate weekly voting to optimize your rewards and maintain your lock at the maximum duration of four years.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I unlock my AERO early?">
    No. Locked `AERO` cannot be unlocked before the expiry date. This is a core design feature of the veAERO system. Plan your lock duration carefully based on your liquidity needs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My lock expired - what happens now?">
    When your lock expires, your veAERO voting power drops to zero but your `AERO` remains locked. You
    can either unlock and withdraw your `AERO` or extend your lock to restore voting power.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I transfer my veAERO NFT?">
    Yes. veAERO is implemented as an NFT, so you can transfer it to another wallet or sell it. The new
    holder will have the voting rights and receive rewards for that position.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add more AERO to an existing lock?">
    Yes. You can increase the amount of `AERO` in an existing lock at any time. Your voting power increases immediately while your lock expiry date remains unchanged. See [Managing your lock](#managing-your-lock) above for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I merge veNFTs with different lock expiry dates?">
    Yes. When you merge veNFTs with different expiry dates, the resulting lock duration is calculated as a **weighted average** based on the amount of `AERO` and remaining lock time in each position.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reverse a permanent lock?">
    No. You cannot reverse a permanent lock under any circumstances. This is by design and cannot be changed. The only way to exit is to sell or transfer the veNFT itself. Never enable a permanent lock unless you are certain of your long-term commitment.
