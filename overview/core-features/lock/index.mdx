This guide is for `AERO` holders who want to participate in governance and earn protocol revenue. You will learn how to lock `AERO` tokens to create `veAERO`, enabling you to vote on emissions, earn protocol revenue, and participate in Aerodrome governance.

<Warning>
  Locked `AERO` cannot be unlocked early. Once you lock your tokens for a duration (minimum 1 week,
  maximum 4 years), they remain locked until the expiry date. You can extend your lock duration but
  never reduce it. Consider your liquidity needs before locking.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

You'll need:

- A Web3 wallet connected to Base (see [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin))
- `AERO` tokens in your wallet
- ETH on Base for gas fees
- Understanding of vote-locking mechanics and risks

## How locking works

Each week, Aerodrome distributes 100% of protocol revenue (swap fees + voting incentives) to <Tooltip tip="Vote-escrowed AERO - locked AERO tokens that grant governance rights">veAERO</Tooltip> voters. When you lock `AERO`, you receive a veAERO position that grants voting power. Your voting power increases proportionally with lock duration, reaching maximum power at four years.

<Tip>
  **Transferable advantage**: Unlike some ve-tokenomics models (e.g., Curve's veCRV), veAERO
  positions are ERC-721 NFTs that you can sell or trade on secondary markets, providing liquidity
  even while locked.
</Tip>

## Lock `AERO` tokens

<Steps>

<Step title="Acquire `AERO` tokens">
  Hold or acquire `AERO` by [swapping](/overview/core-features/swap) directly for `AERO` or
  [receiving `AERO` emissions](/overview/core-features/rewards) as a liquidity provider.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your wallet">
  Connect your wallet by clicking "Connect" in the upper right corner of the Aerodrome interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Create lock">
  Visit the [Lock page](https://aerodrome.finance/lock) and click "Create Lock" to begin the locking
  process.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock amount">
  Choose the amount of `AERO` you want to lock. This amount will be locked for the duration you
  select.
</Step>

<Step title="Select lock duration">
  Choose your lock duration. Locks can be extended but never decreased. Your voting power increases
  proportionally with duration, with maximum voting power achieved at four years.

Your voting power increases proportionally with the duration of your lock, with the maximum voting power achieved at four years.

</Step>

<Step title="Confirm lock creation">
  Confirm the transaction in your wallet and verify your lock appears under "Locks" in your
  [dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dash).
</Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
  After confirming your lock, you may see an `"insufficient balance"` message. This message appears
  because your `AERO` tokens are now locked and no longer available in your wallet balance.
</Tip>

## Managing your lock

After creating your lock, you can modify it in several ways:

### Add more AERO to your lock

Increase the amount of `AERO` in an existing lock to boost your voting power immediately without changing your lock duration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your lock">
  Navigate to your veAERO position in the Locks dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Increase amount">
  Click "Increase Amount" and enter the additional `AERO` you want to add.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm transaction">
  Your voting power increases immediately while your lock expiry date remains unchanged.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Extend your lock duration

Extend your lock expiry date to increase your voting power. You can extend at any time, even before your current lock expires.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your lock">
  Navigate to your veAERO position in the Locks dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Extend duration">
  Click "Extend Lock" and select a new expiry date (must be later than current expiry, up to 4 years
  from now).
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm transaction">
  Your voting power increases based on the new duration. You cannot shorten a lock duration, only extend it.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Optimize with Relays

After creating your lock, you can deposit your veAERO into a <Tooltip tip="Automated liquidity management and voting optimization tool">Relay</Tooltip>. Relays automate weekly voting to optimize your rewards and maintain your lock at the maximum duration of four years.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I unlock my AERO early?">
    No. Locked `AERO` cannot be unlocked before the expiry date. This is a core design feature of the veAERO system. Plan your lock duration carefully based on your liquidity needs.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="My lock expired - what happens now?">
  When your lock expires, your veAERO voting power drops to zero but your `AERO` remains locked. You
  can either unlock and withdraw your `AERO` or extend your lock to restore voting power.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I transfer my veAERO NFT?">
  Yes. veAERO is implemented as an NFT, so you can transfer it to another wallet or sell it. The new
  holder will have the voting rights and receive rewards for that position.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add more AERO to an existing lock?">
    Yes. You can increase the amount of `AERO` in an existing lock at any time. Your voting power increases immediately while your lock expiry date remains unchanged. See [Managing your lock](#managing-your-lock) above for details.
