## Before you begin

You should have voted in at least one Epoch (for voting rewards). If not, read the [Vote](/overview/core-features/vote) page to learn how to vote and earn rewards.

## How to claim rewards

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
  Go to your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dash) and connect your wallet.
  </Step>

<Step title="View available rewards">
  Scroll to the **Voting Rewards** section to see:

- Fee distributions from pools you voted for
- <Tooltip tip="Tokens deposited by protocols to attract votes">Incentives</Tooltip> from pools you
  voted for from pools you voted for
- <Tooltip tip="Weekly AERO emissions distributed to veAERO holders">Rebase rewards</Tooltip> for
  your veAERO balance for your veAERO balance

</Step>

  <Step title="Claim your rewards">
  Choose one of:
  - **Claim All**: Claims all available rewards in a single transaction
  - **Claim** (individual): Claims rewards from a specific pool
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Always verify reward amounts before claiming. Gas fees may exceed small reward values, especially
  for individual pool claims.
</Warning>

## More Information

100% of protocol revenue is distributed each week as voting rewards. There are two sources of protocol revenue: fees and incentives.

### Fees

100% of fees from staked liquidity + 10% fees from unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible concentrated liquidity pools,

Fee rewards are distributed in the same tokens as the liquidity pool tokens these originate from (e.g., if the pool is `AERO/USDC` the distributed tokens are `AERO` and `USDC`).

Fee rewards are distributed as accrued and can be claimed at any time. Fee rewards deposited as voter incentives are available for claim after the epoch changes (Thursday 00:00 UTC), and are distributed proportionally to the voting power cast by a voter.

### Incentives

Incentives are tokens generally deposited by protocols to encourage voting for a specific pool. They can only be deposited for pools that qualify for emissions and are distributed only to voters for that pool, proportionally to their share of pool votes.

These rewards are available for claim after the epoch changes (Thursday 00:00 UTC), and are distributed proportionally to the voting power cast by a voter.

### Timeline

An example of incentives, voting, and rewards claim timeline:

- A new epoch starts Thursday (00:00 UTC)
- Incentives are deposited at any point in the epoch
- Voters vote for their preferred pools
- Once the next epoch arrives (the following Thursday), users are able to claim rewards

[Rebase](/overview/tokenomics/overview#rebase) rewards are claimable after a new epoch has started (Thursday 00:00 UTC).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No rewards showing in my dashboard">
Check that you:
- Voted in the previous Epoch (rewards require active voting)
- Have veAERO tokens (rebase rewards require a lock)
- Waited until Thursday 00:00 UTC for Epoch rewards to become available
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reward amount lower than expected">
Rewards are distributed proportionally based on:
- Your share of total votes on that pool
- Your veAERO balance relative to total veAERO supply
- Pool fees generated during the Epoch
</Accordion>
