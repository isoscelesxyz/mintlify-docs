description: "How to claim voting rewards, fee distributions, and rebase rewards from your Aerodrome positions"
---

You will learn how to claim rewards from your veAERO voting positions and liquidity pools. Aerodrome distributes 100% of protocol revenue to voters each week through three reward types: fee distributions, voter incentives, and rebase rewards.

<Warning>
Always verify reward amounts before claiming. Gas fees may exceed small reward values, especially for individual pool claims.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

You should have:
- A wallet connected to Aerodrome
- veAERO tokens (for voting rewards) or staked liquidity positions (for fee rewards)
- Voted in at least one Epoch (for voting rewards)

## How to claim rewards

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your Dashboard">
Go to [app.aerodrome.finance/dashboard](https://app.aerodrome.finance/dashboard) and connect your wallet.
</Step>

<Step title="View available rewards">
Scroll to the **Voting Rewards** section to see:
- Fee distributions from pools you voted for
- <Tooltip tip="Tokens deposited by protocols to attract votes">Incentives</Tooltip> from pools you voted for
- <Tooltip tip="Weekly AERO emissions distributed to veAERO holders">Rebase rewards</Tooltip> for your veAERO balance
</Step>

<Step title="Claim your rewards">
Choose one of:
- **Claim All**: Claims all available rewards in a single transaction
- **Claim** (individual): Claims rewards from a specific pool
</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding reward types

**Fee distributions**
- 100% of fees from staked liquidity + 10% fees from unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible CL pools
- Distributed in the same tokens as the liquidity pool (e.g., AERO/USDC pool distributes AERO and USDC)
- Available for claim immediately as they accrue

**Voter incentives**
- Tokens deposited by protocols to encourage voting for specific pools
- Only available for pools that qualify for emissions
- Distributed proportionally to your share of votes on that pool
- Claimable after the Epoch changes (Thursday 00:00 UTC)

**Rebase rewards**
- Weekly AERO emissions distributed to veAERO holders
- Amount based on your veAERO balance and lock duration
- Claimable after a new Epoch has started (Thursday 00:00 UTC)

## Reward timeline

<Info>
Here's how the reward cycle works:

- **Thursday 00:00 UTC**: New Epoch starts, previous Epoch rewards become claimable
- **During the Epoch**: Protocols deposit incentives, voters cast votes, fees accrue
- **Following Thursday**: Rewards from the previous Epoch are distributed and can be claimed
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No rewards showing in my dashboard">
Check that you:
- Voted in the previous Epoch (rewards require active voting)
- Have veAERO tokens (rebase rewards require a lock)
- Are connected with the correct wallet
- Waited until Thursday 00:00 UTC for Epoch rewards to become available
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction fails when claiming">
Common causes:
- Insufficient gas (ETH) in your wallet
- Reward amount is too small (try "Claim All" instead)
- Network congestion (try again with higher gas)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reward amount lower than expected">
Rewards are distributed proportionally based on:
- Your share of total votes on that pool
- Your veAERO balance relative to total veAERO supply
- Pool fees generated during the Epoch
</Accordion>
