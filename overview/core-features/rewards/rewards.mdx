**Overview**

100% of protocol revenue is distributed each week as voting rewards. There are two sources of protocol revenue:

**Fees**

100% of fees from staked liquidity + 10% fees from unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible concentrated liquidity pools.

Fee rewards are distributed in the same tokens as the liquidity pool tokens these originate from (e.g., if the pool is vAMM-AERO/USDC the distributed tokens are AERO and USDC).

Fee rewards are distributed as accrued and can be claimed at any time. Fee rewards deposited as voter incentives are available for claim after the epoch changes (Thursday 00:00 UTC), and are distributed proportionally to the voting power cast by a voter.

**Incentives**

Incentives are tokens generally deposited by protocols to encourage voting for a specific pool. They can only be deposited for pools that qualify for emissions and are distributed only to voters for that pool, proportionally to their share of pool votes.

These rewards are available for claim after the epoch changes (Thursday 00:00 UTC), and are distributed proportionally to the voting power cast by a voter.

**Timeline**

An example of incentives, voting, and rewards claim timeline:

- **Epoch starts:** Thursday (00:00 UTC)
- **Incentives deposited:** At any point in the epoch
- **Voting period:** Voters vote for their preferred pools
- **Rewards available:** Once the next epoch arrives (the following Thursday)

**Rebase rewards** are claimable after a new epoch has started (Thursday 00:00 UTC).
