Most users will never interact with the incentive function on Aerodrome. Incentives are almost always deposited by protocols with the aim of encouraging voting for a specific pool as a way to attract votes/emissions that will then attract liquidity providers.

For more information on incentive strategy, reach out to a member of the Aerodrome team.
