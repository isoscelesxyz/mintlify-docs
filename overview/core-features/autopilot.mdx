**Audience**: Liquidity providers seeking automated concentrated liquidity management

**You will learn** how Autopilot automates concentrated liquidity position management, when to use it versus manual CL positions, and the fee structure.

## What is Autopilot?

Autopilot provides automated liquidity management for <Tooltip tip="Concentrated liquidity pools with customizable price ranges and dynamic fees">Slipstream</Tooltip> concentrated liquidity pools, powered by Mellow Finance.

Without automated liquidity management (ALM), liquidity providers must manually adjust their <Tooltip tip="Concentrated liquidity pool positions represented as NFTs">CL positions</Tooltip> to stay within profitable price ranges. Autopilot handles this rebalancing automatically based on market conditions and historical performance.

## How Autopilot works

### Continuous monitoring

Autopilot vaults monitor pool price movements in real-time, tracking when positions move near the edge of their active ranges.

### Automatic rebalancing

When the price moves out of range or approaches range boundaries, Autopilot automatically:
1. Removes liquidity from the current position
2. Calculates optimal new range based on volatility and market depth
3. Re-deposits liquidity in the updated range
4. Stakes the position to earn <Tooltip tip="Weekly AERO token rewards distributed to liquidity pools based on veAERO votes">emissions</Tooltip>

### Batched operations

Autopilot batches multiple user positions together for rebalancing, significantly reducing gas costs per user compared to manual management.

### Fee optimization

Autopilot positions capture swap fees and `AERO` emissions while in range. The automation ensures positions stay active during high-volume periods when fees are most profitable.

## Fee structure

<Info>
Mellow Finance collects **10% of the rewards earned** for providing automated liquidity management. This fee is automatically deducted from your position's earnings.
</Info>

**What you earn:**
- 90% of swap fees from your position
- 90% of `AERO` emissions from gauge staking
- Reduced gas costs through batched rebalancing

**What Mellow earns:**
- 10% of your total rewards (fees + emissions)

## When to use Autopilot

### Use Autopilot when:

✅ **You want passive CL exposure** - No need to monitor price movements or rebalance manually

✅ **Pool has high volatility** - Frequent price swings require regular rebalancing to stay in range

✅ **You're new to concentrated liquidity** - Automated management removes the complexity of range selection

✅ **Gas costs are high** - Batched operations reduce rebalancing costs significantly

✅ **Time constraints** - You can't actively manage positions daily

### Use manual CL when:

❌ **You have strong conviction on price range** - Specific range strategy you want to maintain

❌ **Pool is very stable** - Minimal rebalancing needed (e.g., stablecoin pairs)

❌ **You want maximum control** - Precise control over position parameters and timing

❌ **You can monitor regularly** - Able to rebalance manually when needed

❌ **Pool has low volume** - 10% fee may outweigh benefits in low-earning pools

<Tip>
For most users, Autopilot vaults offer a simpler way to earn from concentrated liquidity without the complexity of manual position management.
</Tip>

## Autopilot vs manual CL management

| Feature | Autopilot | Manual CL |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Rebalancing** | Automatic | Manual |
| **Gas costs** | Lower (batched) | Higher (per rebalance) |
| **Time required** | Passive | Active monitoring |
| **Fees** | 10% of earnings | 0% management fee |
| **Range control** | Automated optimization | Full control |
| **Best for** | Passive LPs, volatile pairs | Active LPs, stable pairs |

## Getting started with Autopilot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an Autopilot vault">
    Visit the [Pools page](https://aerodrome.finance/pools) and filter for Autopilot vaults. These are marked with an "Autopilot" badge.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deposit liquidity">
    Select your desired Autopilot vault and deposit both tokens in the required ratio. The vault will automatically create and manage the CL position.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive vault tokens">
    You'll receive ERC-20 vault tokens representing your share of the Autopilot vault. These tokens can be staked to earn additional `AERO` emissions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor performance">
    Track your vault's performance through the Aerodrome UI. Autopilot will handle all rebalancing automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Withdraw when ready">
    Withdraw from the vault at any time. You'll receive the underlying tokens based on your vault token balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How rebalancing works

When Autopilot rebalances your position:

1. **Trigger conditions** - Price approaches range boundary or moves out of range
2. **Position closure** - Current CL position liquidity is removed
3. **New range calculation** - Algorithm determines optimal new range based on:
   - Current price
   - Recent volatility
   - Liquidity distribution
   - Historical pool data
4. **Position creation** - New CL position opened with updated range
5. **Auto-staking** - Position automatically staked in gauge for emissions

<Warning>
During rebalancing, there may be brief periods where your position is not earning fees. Autopilot minimizes this downtime, but it's a normal part of automated management.
</Warning>

## Understanding Autopilot performance

### What affects returns

**Positive factors:**
- High trading volume = more swap fees
- veAERO votes to your pool = higher emissions
- Efficient rebalancing = more time in range
- Lower gas costs through batching

**Costs to consider:**
- 10% management fee to Mellow
- Impermanent loss (same as manual CL)
- Gas costs for deposits/withdrawals
- Brief downtime during rebalances

### Comparing to alternatives

**Autopilot vs Basic Pools (V2)**:
- ✅ Higher capital efficiency when in range
- ❌ More complex, requires rebalancing
- ✅ Automated management removes manual work

**Autopilot vs Manual CL**:
- ✅ Lower gas costs (batched rebalancing)
- ✅ Automated optimization
- ❌ 10% fee on earnings
- ❌ Less control over exact ranges

<Tip>
Check the vault's historical APR on the Aerodrome app to see net returns after fees and gas costs.
</Tip>

## Risk considerations

<Warning>
Autopilot does not eliminate concentrated liquidity risks. You are still exposed to:

- **Impermanent loss** - Price divergence between tokens affects your position value
- **Range risk** - Even with rebalancing, extreme volatility can cause losses
- **Smart contract risk** - Both Aerodrome and Mellow Finance contracts
- **Fee impact** - 10% management fee reduces net earnings

See [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin) for general DeFi risks.
