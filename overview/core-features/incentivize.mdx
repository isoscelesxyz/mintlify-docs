This guide helps **protocol teams** and **token issuers** use Aerodrome's incentive system to attract votes and bootstrap liquidity. You will learn how to deposit voting incentives (bribes), understand the vote-incentive flywheel, and develop an effective incentive strategy.

## What are voting incentives?

Voting incentives (also called <Tooltip tip="Incentives deposited by protocols to attract votes to their gauges">bribes</Tooltip>) are rewards that protocols deposit to encourage veAERO holders to vote for their liquidity pools. When veAERO holders vote for your pool, it receives a larger share of weekly <Tooltip tip="AERO tokens distributed weekly to liquidity providers based on gauge votes">`AERO` emissions</Tooltip>, which attracts more liquidity providers.

### The incentive flywheel

1. **Protocol deposits incentives** → Attracts veAERO voters
2. **Voters direct emissions** → Pool receives `AERO` rewards
3. **Higher rewards** → Attracts liquidity providers
4. **Deeper liquidity** → Better trading experience
5. **More trading volume** → More fees for voters

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where incentives drive liquidity, which drives volume, which justifies more incentives.

<Warning>
Incentive spending should align with your protocol's liquidity needs and budget. Unsustainable incentive programs can create mercenary liquidity that disappears when incentives stop. Plan for long-term liquidity sustainability.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

Before depositing incentives, ensure you have:

- Understanding of which pool(s) need liquidity
- Tokens allocated for incentive spending
- ROI framework to measure incentive effectiveness
- Understanding of [voting mechanics](/overview/core-features/vote) and [emissions](/overview/tokenomics/emissions)

## How to deposit voting incentives

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the "Vote" page on Aerodrome
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Find the <Tooltip tip="Voting mechanisms for directing emissions to liquidity pools">gauge</Tooltip> for your target pool
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click "Add incentive" on the gauge
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the token you want to use as incentive (your protocol token, AERO, stablecoins, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter the incentive amount
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Approve the token spend and confirm the transaction
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Incentives will be distributed to voters at the end of the current <Tooltip tip="7-day voting periods from Thursday to Wednesday">Epoch</Tooltip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Incentive strategy considerations

### Token choice

Different tokens work better for different goals:

- **Protocol tokens**: Build token holder base, distribute governance
- **Stablecoins (USDC, USDT)**: Attract professional voters, predictable costs
- **`AERO` tokens**: Attract long-term aligned voters, bootstrap veAERO positions

### Timing

- **Launch phase**: Heavy incentives to bootstrap initial liquidity
- **Growth phase**: Moderate incentives to maintain competitiveness
- **Maturity phase**: Reduced incentives as organic volume grows

### ROI calculation

Track these metrics to measure incentive effectiveness:

- Cost per dollar of liquidity attracted
- Incentive spend vs. trading volume generated
- Incentive spend vs. emissions received
- Liquidity retention after incentives stop

## Incentive best practices

**Consistency over bursts**: Steady, predictable incentives attract more reliable liquidity than sporadic large incentives.

**Multi-epoch commitments**: Announce incentive plans for multiple epochs to build voter confidence.

**Diversify token types**: Mix protocol tokens with stablecoins to attract different voter segments.

**Monitor competition**: Track incentive rates on competing pools to stay competitive.

**Build relationships**: Engage with large veAERO holders and voting protocols directly.

<Tip>
Many successful protocols commit to incentive programs spanning 4-12 epochs (1-3 months) to demonstrate long-term commitment and attract stable liquidity.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's a good incentive rate?">
    Competitive incentive rates vary by market conditions. As a baseline, track the ratio of incentive value to emissions value on similar pools. Aim for 50-150% of the emissions value as a starting point, then adjust based on results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I use my protocol token or stablecoins?">
    Protocol tokens help distribute governance and build community, but may have variable value. Stablecoins provide predictable costs and attract professional voters. Many protocols use a mix of both.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I measure ROI on incentives?">
    Compare your incentive spend to: (1) liquidity attracted, (2) trading volume generated, and (3) emissions received. If you spend $100k in incentives to receive $150k in emissions value, that's a 1.5x return before considering volume benefits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should I reduce or stop incentives?">
    Reduce incentives when organic volume can sustain liquidity without subsidies, or when ROI drops below your threshold. Test gradual reductions rather than stopping abruptly to avoid liquidity flight.
