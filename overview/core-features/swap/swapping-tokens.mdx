**Helpful tips:**

- **Slippage tolerance**: If a swap does not execute, try adjusting your slippage tolerance. Assets experiencing volatile pricing swings may require this.
- **Token search**: If you cannot locate a token by searching for the ticker, search by the token address.
- **Large swaps**: Be aware that swapping large amounts in low-liquidity pools can lead to high slippage and inefficient swaps.

<Info>
"Slippage" refers to the difference between the price quoted before the swap and the actual executed price due to market movements or liquidity depth.
