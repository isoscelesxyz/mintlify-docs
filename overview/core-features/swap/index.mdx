As the essential trading hub of Base, Aerodrome is the exchange of choice for users who want to swap tokens on the network. Due to Aerodrome’s deep liquidity and innovative mechanics, users typically experience low swap fees and minimal <Tooltip tip="The difference between the quoted price and the actual executed price due to market movements or liquidity depth">slippage</Tooltip> when exchanging tokens.

## How to swap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    Visit the [Swap page](https://aerodrome.finance/swap) and click "Connect" in the upper right corner to connect your wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select tokens">
    In the **Sell** field, select the token you want to swap from.

    In the **Buy** field, select the token you want to receive.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter amount">
    Input the amount you'd like to trade in either the Sell or Buy field. The other field will automatically calculate based on the current exchange rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the quote">
    Review the exchange rate, fees, and slippage tolerance. Check the price impact percentage to ensure it's acceptable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve tokens (if needed)">
    If this is your first time swapping this token, you'll need to approve the contract to spend your tokens. Click **Approve** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

    _This is giving permission to the contract to spend your tokens on your behalf for the amount you've chosen in order to make the swap._

  </Step>
  <Step title="View confirmation">
    After the transaction completes, you can view the receipt by clicking **View confirmation**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding swap basics

<Warning>
  Large swaps in low-liquidity pools can result in high slippage and price impact. Always review the
  quote and price impact before confirming your swap.
</Warning>

### Slippage tolerance

Slippage occurs when the price changes between when you submit a transaction and when it's executed
onchain.

**Slippage tolerance** is the maximum price movement you'll accept:

- **Default**: 0.5% (suitable for most swaps)
- **Low liquidity pools**: May need 1-2%
- **Volatile tokens**: May need 3-5%
- **Stable pairs**: Can use 0.1-0.3%

<Warning>

  <Tooltip tip="Maximal Extractable Value - a type of attack on the network where an attacker can extract the maximum value from a transaction">
    MEV
  </Tooltip>{" "}
  <span>attacks and poor execution. Only increase when necessary.</span>
</Warning>

### Price impact

Price impact shows how much your trade will move the market price:

- **Less than 0.5%**: Normal for most trades
- **0.5-1%**: Acceptable for medium trades
- **Greater than 1%**: High impact - consider splitting trade
- **Greater than 5%**: Very high - trade size too large for pool liquidity

<Tip>
  For large swaps, split into smaller trades to reduce price impact. This may cost more in gas but
  results in better execution.
</Tip>

### Route preview

Aerodrome automatically finds the best route for your swap:

- **Single-hop**: Direct swap through one pool

  `TOKEN_A → TOKEN_B`

- **Multi-hop**: Routes through multiple pools for better pricing

  `TOKEN_A → WETH → TOKEN_B`

The UI shows the route before you confirm. Multi-hop routes cost more gas but may provide better prices.

  Swapping](/overview/core-features/swap/advanced) for multi-hop mechanics and optimization
  strategies.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed: 'Insufficient allowance'">
    **Cause**: You haven't approved the token for the Aerodrome router.

    **Solution**:

    1. Click **"Approve [TOKEN]"** button
    2. Confirm approval transaction in wallet
    3. Wait for confirmation
    4. Retry swap

    <Info>
      Approvals are one-time per token. After approving once, you won't need to approve again for that token.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed: 'Transaction deadline exceeded'">
    **Cause**: Transaction took too long to process (default 30-minute deadline).

    **Solution**:

    - Retry the swap with current prices
    - Increase deadline in swap settings if network is congested
    - Check Base network status for issues

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High slippage warning">
    **Cause**: Low pool liquidity or large trade size relative to available liquidity.

    **Solution**:

    - **Reduce trade amount** to lower price impact
    - **Increase slippage tolerance** carefully (be aware of MEV risks)
    - **Wait for better liquidity** in the pool
    - **Check alternative routes** or pools

    <Tip>
      Check the pool's TVL before large swaps. Pools with \>\$100k liquidity typically handle larger trades better.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find a token">
    **Cause**: Token not in default list or misspelled ticker.

    **Solution**:

    1. Click token selector dropdown
    2. Paste token **contract address** directly
    3. Verify address from official sources
    4. Token appears if it exists on Base

    <Warning>
      Always verify contract addresses from official project sources. Scam tokens with similar names exist.
    </Warning>
    Verified addresses: [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/overview#contract-addresses) or [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Swap quote seems wrong or outdated">
    **Cause**: Prices moved since quote was generated, or pool liquidity changed.

    **Solution**:

    - Refresh the swap page
    - Re-enter amounts to get fresh quote
    - Check if you're comparing against different pools/CEXs (prices vary)
    - Verify you're looking at the correct token (many have similar names)
