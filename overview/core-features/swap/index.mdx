---

In this guide, you will learn how to swap tokens on Aerodrome. This guide is for anyone who wants to exchange tokens on Base using Aerodrome's liquidity pools.

## How it works

Aerodrome enables token swaps by routing trades through liquidity pools. Due to deep liquidity and efficient routing, swaps typically experience low fees and minimal <Tooltip tip="The difference between the quoted price and the actual executed price due to market movements or liquidity depth">slippage</Tooltip>.

<Warning>
  Large swaps in low-liquidity pools can result in high slippage and price
  impact. Always review the quote and price impact before confirming your swap.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

- You need a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Rainbow) connected to Base
- You need the tokens you want to swap, plus ETH for gas fees
- Ensure you understand slippage tolerance and price impact

## How to swap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    Click **Connect** in the upper right corner of [Aerodrome Finance](https://aerodrome.finance/swap) and select your wallet.

    In the **Buy** field, select the token you want to receive.

  </Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Enter amount">
  Input the amount you'd like to trade in either the Sell or Buy field. The
  other field will automatically calculate based on the current exchange rate.
</Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Review the quote">
  Review the exchange rate, fees, and slippage tolerance. Check the price impact
  percentage to ensure it's acceptable.
</Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Approve tokens (if needed)">
  If this is your first time swapping this token, you'll need to approve the
  contract to spend your tokens. Click **Approve** and confirm the transaction
  in your wallet.
</Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Complete the swap">
  Click **Swap** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## Understanding swap basics

### Slippage tolerance

<Tooltip tip="The difference between the quoted price and the actual executed price">
  Slippage
</Tooltip> occurs when the price changes between when you submit a transaction and
when it's executed onchain.

**Slippage tolerance** is the maximum price movement you'll accept:

- **Default**: 0.5% (suitable for most swaps)
- **Low liquidity pools**: May need 1-2%
- **Volatile tokens**: May need 3-5%
- **Stable pairs**: Can use 0.1-0.3%

<Warning>
  Setting slippage too high (>5%) exposes you to MEV attacks and poor execution.
  Only increase when necessary.
</Warning>

### Price impact

Price impact shows how much your trade will move the market price:

- **Less than 0.5%**: Normal for most trades
- **0.5-1%**: Acceptable for medium trades
- **Greater than 1%**: High impact - consider splitting trade
- **Greater than 5%**: Very high - trade size too large for pool liquidity

<Tip>
  For large swaps, split into smaller trades to reduce price impact. This may
  cost more in gas but results in better execution.
</Tip>

### Route preview

Aerodrome automatically finds the best route for your swap:

- **Single-hop**: Direct swap through one pool (TOKEN_A/TOKEN_B)
- **Multi-hop**: Routes through multiple pools for better pricing (TOKEN_A → WETH → TOKEN_B)

The UI shows the route before you confirm. Multi-hop routes cost more gas but may provide better prices.

  Swapping](/overview/core-features/swap/advanced) for multi-hop mechanics and
  optimization strategies.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed: 'Insufficient allowance'" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Cause**: You haven't approved the token for the Aerodrome router.

    **Solution**:
    1. Click **"Approve [TOKEN]"** button
    2. Confirm approval transaction in wallet
    3. Wait for confirmation
    4. Retry swap

    <Info>
    Approvals are one-time per token. After approving once, you won't need to approve again for that token.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction failed: 'Transaction deadline exceeded'" icon="clock">
    **Cause**: Transaction took too long to process (default 30-minute deadline).

    **Solution**:
    - Retry the swap with current prices
    - Increase deadline in swap settings if network is congested
    - Check Base network status for issues

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High slippage warning" icon="percent">
    **Cause**: Low pool liquidity or large trade size relative to available liquidity.

    **Solution**:
    - **Reduce trade amount** to lower price impact
    - **Increase slippage tolerance** carefully (be aware of MEV risks)
    - **Wait for better liquidity** in the pool
    - **Check alternative routes** or pools

    <Tip>
    Check the pool's TVL before large swaps. Pools with >$100k liquidity typically handle larger trades better.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a token" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Cause**: Token not in default list or misspelled ticker.

    **Solution**:
    1. Click token selector dropdown
    2. Paste token **contract address** directly
    3. Verify address from official sources
    4. Token appears if it exists on Base

    <Warning>
    Always verify contract addresses from official project sources. Scam tokens with similar names exist.
    </Warning>

    Verified addresses: [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/overview#contract-addresses) or [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Swap quote seems wrong or outdated" icon="circle-question">
    **Cause**: Prices moved since quote was generated, or pool liquidity changed.

    **Solution**:
    - Refresh the swap page
    - Re-enter amounts to get fresh quote
    - Check if you're comparing against different pools/CEXs (prices vary)
    - Verify you're looking at the correct token (many have similar names)
