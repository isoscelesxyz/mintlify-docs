This page explains how Aerodrome's swap system works under the hood. For step-by-step instructions, see [Swapping Tokens](/overview/core-features/swap).

## Routing

Aerodrome automatically finds the optimal path for your swap, even when a direct pool doesn't exist.

### How routes are discovered

The interface evaluates potential routes by:

1. **Discovering paths** - Finding all possible routes up to 3 hops, prioritizing high-liquidity connector tokens (USDC, WETH, AERO)
2. **Fetching quotes** - Querying on-chain quoter contracts for each potential route
3. **Comparing outputs** - Selecting the route that returns the most tokens after fees and price impact
4. **Mixing pool types** - Routes can combine Basic, Stable, and CL pools for optimal pricing

The interface selects the path with the **best net output** and submits it to the Universal Router for execution.

### Route examples

**Single-hop (direct)**:
```
USDC → [USDC/WETH pool] → WETH
```

**Multi-hop (indirect)**:
```
RARE_TOKEN → [RARE_TOKEN/WETH pool] → WETH → [WETH/USDC pool] → USDC
```

**Mixed pool types**:
```
TOKEN_A → WETH → USDC

Route: TOKEN_A/WETH (Basic pool) → WETH/USDC (CL pool)
```

<Info>
  The UI displays the route before you confirm. You'll see something like "USDC → WETH → AERO"
  showing the path your swap will take.
</Info>

### Connector tokens

Routes frequently pass through these high-liquidity tokens:

- **WETH** - Most liquid base pair, connects most tokens
- **USDC** - Stable liquidity hub
- **AERO** - Native protocol token with deep liquidity

## Fee Structures

### Basic Pool Fees

Basic pools have fixed fees:

| Pool Type | Fee   |
| --------- | ----- |
| Stable    | 0.05% |
| Volatile  | 0.30% |

Governance can set custom fees (0-3%) for specific pools.

### CL Pool Fees

Slipstream concentrated liquidity pools have fees based on tick spacing:

| Tick Spacing | Fee    | Typical Use Case            |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1            | 0.01%  | Highly correlated pairs     |
| 50           | 0.05%  | Stable pairs                |
| 100          | 0.05%  | Stable pairs                |
| 200          | 0.30%  | Standard volatile pairs     |
| 2000         | 1.00%  | Exotic/low-liquidity pairs  |

Governance can set custom fees (up to 3%) for specific pools.

### Total swap cost

Your total cost includes:

1. **Pool fees** - 0.01% to 1% depending on pool type
2. **Price impact** - Depends on trade size vs liquidity
3. **Gas fees** - ~$0.05-0.30 on Base

## Universal Router

Aerodrome uses a Universal Router that handles all swap types in a single transaction.

The Universal Router can:

- Execute swaps across **Basic pools** (stable and volatile)
- Execute swaps across **CL pools** (concentrated liquidity)
- **Mix pool types** in a single route for optimal pricing
- Handle ETH wrapping/unwrapping automatically

<Info>
  The interface automatically constructs the optimal route and submits it to the Universal Router. You don't need to interact with router contracts directly.

## Epoch Timing

Liquidity on Aerodrome can shift at epoch transitions (Thursday 00:00 UTC) when:

- veAERO votes are tallied
- Emissions are redistributed to gauges
- LPs may reposition based on new incentives

This typically has minor impact on swap routing, but large trades near epoch boundaries may see liquidity changes.

---

## Large Trades

For trades >$10,000:

**Split across time**:
- Execute 25% of trade, wait 5-10 minutes, repeat
- Reduces price impact and MEV exposure

**Consider OTC** (>$100k):
- Direct negotiation with LPs or protocols
- Contact via [Discord](https://discord.gg/aerodrome) for coordination

<Tip>
  For swaps >1% of pool TVL, expect noticeable price impact. Consider splitting into smaller
  portions.
