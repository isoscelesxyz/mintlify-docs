---

This deep-dive is for **power users, traders, and anyone wanting to understand Aerodrome's swap mechanics in depth**. You will learn how Aerodrome's routing works, when to adjust slippage, how to minimize price impact, and advanced swap optimization techniques.

## Multi-Hop Routing

Aerodrome automatically finds the optimal path for your swap, even when a direct pool doesn't exist.

### How routing works

The Aerodrome interface discovers the best execution path by evaluating all possible routes across available pools:

**Single-hop (direct)**:

```txt
USDC → [USDC/WETH pool] → WETH
```

**Multi-hop (indirect)**:

```txt
RARE_TOKEN → [RARE_TOKEN/WETH pool] → WETH → [WETH/USDC pool] → USDC
```

### Route selection

The interface evaluates potential routes by:

1. **Discovering paths** - Finding all possible routes up to 3 hops, prioritizing high-liquidity connector tokens (USDC, WETH, AERO)
2. **Fetching quotes** - Querying on-chain quoter contracts for each potential route
3. **Comparing outputs** - Selecting the route that returns the most tokens after fees and price impact
4. **Mixing pool types** - Routes can combine Basic, Stable, and CL pools for optimal pricing

The interface selects the path with the **best net output** and submits it to the Universal Router contract for execution.

### Multi-hop considerations

**Advantages**:

- ✅ Access to tokens without direct pools
- ✅ Better pricing through liquidity aggregation
- ✅ Automatic optimization (no manual route selection)

**Tradeoffs**:

- ❌ Higher gas costs (each hop adds transactions)
- ❌ Slightly higher slippage risk (price changes in multiple pools)
- ❌ More complex failure modes

<Info>
  The UI displays the route before you confirm. You'll see something like "USDC → WETH → AERO"
  showing the path your swap will take.
</Info>

### Common routing patterns

**Intermediate tokens** frequently used in routes:

- **WETH** - Most liquid base pair, connects most tokens
- **USDC** - Stable liquidity hub
- **AERO** - Native protocol token with deep liquidity

**Example routes**:

- cbBTC → USDC: `cbBTC → WETH → USDC`
- AERO → DAI: `AERO → USDC → DAI`
- Obscure token → Any: `TOKEN → WETH → [target]`

<Tip>
  If a swap shows high price impact, the pair may lack direct liquidity. Providing liquidity to
  create a direct pool can be profitable if you trade this pair frequently.
</Tip>

## Slippage Mechanics Deep-Dive

### What slippage tolerance actually does

When you set slippage tolerance to 0.5%, you're saying:

> "I'll accept up to 0.5% worse price than the current quote, but if it's worse than that, the transaction should fail."

**Example**:

- Quote: 1 ETH = 3,000 USDC
- 0.5% slippage: Accept as low as 2,985 USDC
- If execution would give less than 2,985 USDC: transaction reverts

### Why slippage happens

**Legitimate causes**:

1. **Market movement** - Price changed between submission and execution (common on volatile tokens)
2. **Other transactions** - Someone else traded before your transaction processed
3. **Low liquidity** - Your trade significantly moves the pool price (price impact)

**Malicious causes**: 4. **MEV/Sandwich attacks** - Bots front-run your trade to extract value 5. **Rug pulls** - Token contract manipulates pricing

### Slippage settings by scenario

| Scenario                       | Recommended Slippage | Reasoning                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Stablecoin swaps (USDC/DAI)    | 0.1-0.3%             | Very low volatility           |
| Established tokens (WETH/AERO) | 0.5-1%               | Standard volatility           |
| Volatile pairs (new tokens)    | 2-5%                 | High volatility, wide spreads |
| Low liquidity pools            | 3-5%                 | Large price impact expected   |
| Large trades (>$10k)           | 1-2%                 | Price impact + timing risk    |

<Warning>
  Never set slippage above 10% unless you fully understand the risks. High slippage tolerance makes
  you vulnerable to MEV extraction and poor execution.
</Warning>

### Slippage vs price impact

**These are different concepts**:

**Price impact**:

- How much your trade moves the market price
- Determined by trade size vs pool liquidity
- Shows BEFORE you submit transaction
- Real economic cost (you're moving the market)

**Slippage tolerance**:

- Maximum additional price movement you'll accept
- Protection mechanism (transaction reverts if exceeded)
- Set by you
- Acts as safety limit

**Example**:

- Trade shows 1.2% price impact (unavoidable)
- You set 2% slippage tolerance
- Transaction fails if execution is >2% worse than quote
- You're protected from >2% total slippage, but still pay the 1.2% impact

---

## Price Impact Optimization

### Understanding price impact

Price impact is the difference between market price and your execution price caused by your trade size.

**Formula concept**:

```txt
Price Impact = (Market Price - Your Execution Price) / Market Price × 100%
```

### Impact thresholds

**Less than 0.1%** - Negligible

- Normal for small trades in liquid pools
- Minimal cost to you

**0.1% - 0.5%** - Low

- Acceptable for most trades
- Standard for medium trades in liquid pools

**0.5% - 1%** - Moderate

- Acceptable for larger trades
- Consider splitting if optimizing for price

**1% - 3%** - High

- Your trade is significant relative to pool liquidity
- Consider splitting into multiple trades

**Greater than 3%** - Very High

- Trade size too large for pool liquidity
- Splitting is strongly recommended
- Consider OTC if available

<Warning>
  Price impact is a real cost - not just a warning. A 5% price impact means you're paying 5% more
  than market price. This cost is separate from swap fees.
</Warning>

### Reducing price impact

**1. Split large trades**:

```txt
Instead of: 1 trade of 100 ETH (5% impact)
Do: 5 trades of 20 ETH each (1% impact each)

Result: Better average price (lower total cost)
Tradeoff: Higher gas costs (5 transactions)
```

**2. Wait for better liquidity**:

- LPs may add liquidity throughout the day
- Epoch transitions (Thursday) often see liquidity changes
- After veAERO votes, emissions change pool attractiveness

**3. Provide liquidity yourself**:

- If you trade frequently in a pair
- Add liquidity to earn fees from your own (and others') trades
- Reduce your future price impact

## Pool Fee Structures

### Basic Pool Fees

Basic pools have fixed fees:

- **Stable pools**: 0.05% (optimized for low-volatility pairs like stablecoins)
- **Volatile pools**: 0.30% (standard pairs)
- **Custom fees**: Governance can set custom fees (0-3%) for specific pools

### CL Pool Fees

Slipstream concentrated liquidity pools have fees based on tick spacing:

| Tick Spacing | Fee    | Typical Use Case |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| 1            | 0.01%  | Highly correlated pairs |
| 50           | 0.05%  | Stable pairs |
| 100          | 0.05%  | Stable pairs |
| 200          | 0.30%  | Standard volatile pairs |
| 2000         | 1.00%  | Exotic/low-liquidity pairs |

Governance can set custom fees (up to 3%) for specific pools via a modular fee system.

<Info>
  All fees are calculated entirely onchain. The fee for each pool is determined by its tick spacing configuration.
</Info>

### How fees affect your swap

Your total swap cost includes:

1. **Pool fees**: 0.01% - 1% depending on pool type and configuration
2. **Price impact**: Depends on trade size and liquidity
3. **Gas fees**: Base network transaction costs

**Example**:

```txt
Swap 10 WETH → USDC in CL pool:
- Market price: 1 WETH = $3,000
- Pool fee: 0.3% = $9 per ETH
- Price impact: 0.2% = $6 per ETH
- Gas: ~$0.10 on Base

Total cost: $150 fees + $60 impact + $0.10 gas = $210.10 total cost
Effective price: $2,979 per WETH (vs $3,000 market)
```

## Router Architecture

Aerodrome uses a Universal Router that handles all swap types in a single transaction.

### How it works

The Universal Router is a command-based contract that can:

- Execute swaps across **Basic pools** (stable and volatile)
- Execute swaps across **CL pools** (concentrated liquidity)
- **Mix pool types** in a single route for optimal pricing
- Handle ETH wrapping/unwrapping automatically

<Info>
  The Aerodrome interface automatically constructs the optimal route and submits it to the Universal Router. You don't need to interact with router contracts directly.
</Info>

### Cross-pool type routing

Routes can mix pool types for optimal pricing:

```txt
TOKEN_A → WETH → USDC

Route: TOKEN_A/WETH (Basic pool) → WETH/USDC (CL pool)

Result: Best execution by using deepest liquidity for each hop
```

The interface groups consecutive pools of the same type and generates optimized commands for the Universal Router.

## Advanced Trading Strategies

### Timing your swaps

**Optimal timing considerations**:

**Low volatility periods**:

- ✅ Tighter spreads
- ✅ More predictable execution
- ✅ Lower price impact
- Best for: Routine swaps, large trades

**High volatility periods**:

- ❌ Wider spreads
- ❌ Less predictable execution
- ❌ Higher MEV risk
- ⚠️ Only trade if necessary

**Epoch transitions** (Thursday 00:00 UTC):

- Votes change, emissions adjust
- Liquidity may shift between pools
- May affect routing and pricing
- Generally minor impact on swaps

### Large trade execution

For trades >$10,000:

**1. Split across time**:

- Execute 25% of trade
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Execute next 25%
- Reduces visible order size

**2. Consider OTC** (very large trades):

- For >$100k trades
- Direct negotiation with LPs or protocols
- Better pricing, no public slippage
- Contact via Discord for coordination

### Monitoring pool liquidity

Before large swaps, you can check pool stats on the Aerodrome pools page:

- **TVL**: Total value locked in pool
- **Volume/TVL ratio**: Higher = better liquidity utilization
- **Recent activity**: Check BaseScan for pool transactions

<Tip>
  For swaps >1% of pool TVL, expect noticeable price impact. Consider splitting the trade into
  smaller portions.
</Tip>

## MEV and Front-Running Protection

### What is MEV?

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) refers to bots extracting value from pending transactions.

**Sandwich attacks**:

1. Bot sees your pending swap
2. Bot front-runs: buys tokens before you
3. Your swap executes at worse price
4. Bot back-runs: sells tokens for profit

Your loss = bot's profit (extracted via slippage tolerance)

### Protection strategies

**1. Use tighter slippage**:

- Lower slippage = less room for MEV extraction
- Tradeoff: Transaction may fail if market moves
- Sweet spot: 0.5-1% for most trades

**2. Private transactions** (if supported):

- Flashbots Protect or similar
- Prevents public mempool visibility
- Not always available on Base

**3. Split large trades**:

- Smaller trades = less MEV profitability
- Makes sandwich attacks uneconomical

**4. Trade during low activity**:

- Less bot competition
- Lower mempool congestion
- Better execution environment

<Info>
  Base's fast block times (2 seconds) reduce MEV window compared to Ethereum. This provides some
  natural protection.
</Info>

## Fee Comparison: Aerodrome vs Other DEXs

### Why fees matter

Swap fees are a percentage of your trade value, paid to liquidity providers:

**0.01% fee** on $10,000 swap = $1 in fees
**0.3% fee** on $10,000 swap = $30 in fees

Over many trades, fees compound significantly.

### Aerodrome's advantage

**CL pools**:

- Concentrated liquidity means deeper liquidity at active prices
- Multiple fee tiers (0.01% to 1%) for different pair types
- Lower price impact for trades within active ranges

**Basic pools**:

- Competitive fixed fees (0.05% stable, 0.30% volatile)
- Deep liquidity from emissions incentives
- Tight spreads on popular pairs

**Routing efficiency**:

- Finds cheapest path across all pool types
- May route through lower-fee pools when available
- Optimizes for net output (fees + impact + gas)

---

## Understanding Execution Quality

### What makes a good swap?

Not just lowest fees - consider total execution quality:

**1. Net price received**:

- Quoted price - fees - price impact - slippage = actual price
- Compare net price across DEXs, not just fees

**2. Execution certainty**:

- Will transaction succeed?
- Is liquidity sufficient?
- Is slippage tolerance appropriate?

**3. Speed**:

- Base: ~2 second blocks (very fast)
- Transaction confirms quickly
- Reduces timing risk

**4. Cost efficiency**:

- Gas costs on Base are low (~$0.05-0.20)
- Multi-hop trades cost more but may save on price impact
- Net cost = gas + fees + impact

### Comparing quotes

When evaluating swap quotes:

```txt
DEX A Quote:
- Gross price: 3,000 USDC per ETH
- Fee: 0.3% = $9
- Price impact: 0.5% = $15
- Gas: $0.10
- Net received: 2,976 USDC
- Total cost: $24.10

DEX B Quote:
- Gross price: 3,005 USDC per ETH
- Fee: 0.05% = $1.50
- Price impact: 2% = $60
- Gas: $0.50
- Net received: 2,943.50 USDC
- Total cost: $62

Winner: DEX A (better net execution despite higher fees)
```

Always compare **net received**, not just fees or gross quotes.

## Advanced Scenarios

### Swapping new or exotic tokens

**Challenges**:

- Limited liquidity (high price impact)
- No direct pools (requires multi-hop)
- High volatility (requires higher slippage)
- Potential scam tokens

**Best practices**:

1. **Verify token contract** - Check official sources
2. **Start small** - Test with tiny amount first
3. **Check liquidity** - See pool TVL and recent volume
4. **Use higher slippage** - 3-5% may be necessary
5. **Monitor chart** - Ensure price movement is legitimate

### Swapping during high volatility

**Market volatility affects swaps**:

- Prices change rapidly between quote and execution
- Higher slippage tolerance needed
- Greater MEV risk (bots capitalize on volatility)

**Strategies**:

- Accept higher slippage (2-3%) for execution certainty
- Use smaller trade sizes to reduce MEV profitability
- Wait for volatility to calm if not urgent
- Monitor multiple sources (is price change real?)

---

## Gas Optimization

### Minimizing transaction costs

**Gas costs on Base** (approximate):

- Simple swap: $0.05 - $0.10
- Swap with approval: $0.10 - $0.20
- Multi-hop swap: $0.15 - $0.30

**Optimization strategies**:

**1. Batch operations when possible**:

- If swapping multiple tokens, consider timing
- Combine with other actions (claim + swap, etc.)

**2. Approve once per token**:

- First swap requires approval (~$0.05)
- Subsequent swaps skip approval
- Use infinite approval or approve exact amounts

**3. Consider trade-offs**:

- Multi-hop may cost more gas but save on price impact
- Direct route may cost less gas but worse execution
- Net savings = impact savings - gas increase

**4. Monitor Base gas prices**:

- Base is generally cheap and consistent
- Occasional spikes during high activity
- Rarely worth waiting for gas to drop
