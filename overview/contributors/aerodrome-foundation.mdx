The Aerodrome Foundation is a registered Cayman Islands charity dedicated to the support of the Aerodrome Protocol.

## Foundation Wallets

The launch of Aerodrome included the creation of three ecosystem wallets: Public Goods, Flight School, and DevCo. Each of them serve a discrete and vital function for Aerodrome and the broader network. 100% of the AERO in these wallets is auto-max locked as veAERO. The Aerodrome Foundation directly controls two of them:

1. Public Goods NFT
This wallet votes each week to send emissions to pools with assets that are strategically important but temporarily under-supported by the market. 100% of profit accrued by this wallet is re-compounded into veAERO, growing the position over time without any extraction.

2. Flight School
This wallet votes each week, collects voting rewards and uses 100% of profits to buy back AERO from the market. It then locks all AERO acquired and distributes it as veAERO to new lockers. This wallet helps bring new users into the system, expanding the base of active, aligned governance participants (see Flight School for more).

**Buy-backs**
Across ecosystem wallets, ~30% of protocol revenue is programmatically routed back into the system. In a MetaDEX, buybacks are different than in traditional systems because they structurally reduce dilution and preserve the economic positions of active participants. No one has a claim to the profits from Public Goods or Flight School wallets, including the Foundation.

## Liquid AERO

The Aerodrome Foundation received an airdrop of 40M liquid AERO as an incentives fund.

**Incentives Fund:**

- **10M of AERO was used as incentives in the community launch of the token.**
- The rest will be used to create more yield for veAERO voters and incentivize strategic pools when we aren't able to do this with vote power.
- As of 9/16 30M remains in this fund

Launching the Aero token:

- No liquidity was seeded
- Liquid AERO was deposited as incentives
- Market added liquidity and set the price

Market Making deals:

Velodrome Foundation Partnership: The Velodrome Foundation received an AERO airdrop based on the tokens that were locked outside of any initial allocations. This is used to support public goods on Velodrome and the funding needs of both foundations.
