## The MetaDEX

Dromos is the creator of the MetaDEX, the next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) model that underlies Velodrome and Aerodrome.

### The Technology

#### The most powerful and trusted AMMs in DeFi, all in one platform.

MetaDEX01 brought constant-product and stable swap AMMs together. MetaDEX02 introduced Slipstream, an innovative take on concentrated liquidity that decoupled fees and tick-spacing and allowed for wider ranges and more strategic rewards streaming.

#### Modular architecture for accelerated innovation and flexibility.

A flexible smart contract design enables faster iteration and seamless integration of new pool types as well things like improved dynamic fee algorithms.

#### Integrated liquidity and governance management tools.

From native incentive functionality to automated vote optimization, the MetaDEX reduces the need for external systems that extract value.

### The Economics

#### Maximum token utility

The native token of a MetaDEX represents a claim to 100% of future protocol revenue. It is not a glorified memecoin or empty governance tool.

#### Ownership aligned with participation

The MetaDEX’s perpetual emissions schedule allows for the weekly shifting of power (and value capture) to reward only those who actively contribute to the ecosystem. Only with perpetual emissions can a system reduce privilege based on tenure or status to incentivize long-term commitment and active participation.

#### Vote-lock governance

The MetaDEX distributes revenue only to users who have demonstrated long-term commitment to the health of the protocol, thus creating total alignment and minimizing any incentive to drive short-term personal gain at the expense of the system.

### The MetaDEX Difference

All together, the MetaDEX model provides traders with low-slippage swaps and helps protocols efficiently create deep liquidity for their tokens:

- Replaces traditional intermediaries with immutable code and trustless operations.
- Allows token-holders to direct emissions through decentralized governance, ensuring liquidity is incentivized effectively and sustainably.
- Returns 100% of the economic value generated to voters, aligning incentives across all stakeholders.
- Funds development and operations exclusively through participation rather than private sales or centralized funding, ensuring team alignment with the broader community.

The MetaDEX exemplifies DeFi’s original promise: a decentralized, permissionless, and economically aligned ecosystem built around genuine token utility, open ownership, and transparent value distribution.

<Note>
  The MetaDEX model is an evolution of the ve(3,3) model pioneered by [Andre
  Cronje](https://x.com/AndreCronjeTech). It includes trusted AMM designs popularized by Uniswap and
  Curve Finance along with additional native tools. For more on the MetaDEX, read the [Dromos

## Funding

The ethos of decentralization influences not just Aerodrome’s technology and governance, but also how the protocol itself is funded and sustained. From day one, Aerodrome has operated without private investment or token sales. Instead, ongoing development and operations are funded through active participation in the protocol’s revenue-sharing mechanics. This structure ensures complete alignment across all stakeholders, including core contributors.

The protocol maintains a dedicated, permanently max-locked voting position that has accumulated/accumulates veAERO from two distinct streams:

- ### Initial Allocation

  At launch, 19% of the initial supply of AERO was set aside as a funding source for future development. Because these tokens remain locked indefinitely, the working team’s incentives are permanently aligned with the protocol’s long-term health and growth. Individual team members did not receive vesting tokens.

- ### Ongoing Emissions

  An ongoing allocation of 5% of weekly AERO emissions is directed to the devco address. These emissions help maintain the team’s max-locked voting share in order to fund future development. All revenue is earned directly from protocol performance, just like all users without the need to sell any liquid tokens to either fund the team or attract external capital

This unique structure ensures transparency and resilience. Contributors earn directly from protocol revenue under the same rules as all other users. As the protocol grows, available resources for development naturally expand; if revenues contract, funding proportionally adjusts. This eliminates privileged funding channels, ensuring all stakeholders share unified incentives to maximize long-term economic value.
