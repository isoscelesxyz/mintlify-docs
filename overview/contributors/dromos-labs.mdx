This page explains who builds Aerodrome, how development is funded, and why the team's incentives are permanently aligned with protocol success. You will understand the MetaDEX model and the unique funding structure that ensures transparency.

**Primary audience**: Protocol teams, advanced users, and governance participants curious about Aerodrome's development and economic structure.

**About Dromos**

Dromos Labs is the core contributing development company behind Aerodrome and Velodrome, the leading decentralized exchanges on Base and the Optimism Superchain. Dromos builds the MetaDEX model and provides ongoing technical development for both protocols.

## The MetaDEX

Dromos is the creator of the MetaDEX, the next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) model that underlies Velodrome and Aerodrome.

**MetaDEX Technology:**

MetaDEX technology includes:

- **Powerful and trusted AMMs**: MetaDEX01 brought constant-product and stable swap AMMs together. MetaDEX02 introduced Slipstream, an innovative take on concentrated liquidity that decoupled fees and tick-spacing and allowed for wider ranges and more strategic rewards streaming.

- **Modular architecture**: A flexible smart contract design enables faster iteration and seamless integration of new pool types as well as improved dynamic fee algorithms.

- **Integrated tools**: From native incentive functionality to automated vote optimization, the MetaDEX reduces the need for external systems that extract value.

**MetaDEX Economics:**

The MetaDEX model is built on three key economic principles:

- **Maximum token utility**: The native token of a MetaDEX represents a claim to 100% of future protocol revenue.

- **Ownership aligned with participation**: The MetaDEX's perpetual emissions schedule allows for the weekly shifting of power and value capture to reward those who actively contribute to the ecosystem.

- **Vote-lock governance**: The MetaDEX distributes revenue only to users who have demonstrated long-term commitment to the health of the protocol, creating alignment and minimizing incentives for short-term personal gain.

**MetaDEX Advantages:**

The MetaDEX model provides traders with low-slippage swaps and helps protocols efficiently create deep liquidity for their tokens. Key advantages include:

- **Replace intermediaries**: Immutable code and trustless operations replace traditional intermediaries.
- **Decentralized governance**: Token-holders direct emissions through decentralized governance, ensuring liquidity is incentivized effectively and sustainably.
- **Aligned value distribution**: Returns 100% of the economic value generated to voters, aligning incentives across all stakeholders.
- **Community-funded development**: Development and operations are funded exclusively through participation rather than private sales or centralized funding, ensuring team alignment with the broader community.

<Info>
The MetaDEX model is an evolution of the <Tooltip tip="Vote-escrow combined with (3,3) game theory from OlympusDAO">ve(3,3)</Tooltip> model pioneered by Andre Cronje. It includes trusted AMM designs popularized by Uniswap and Curve Finance along with additional native tools.

**Funding**

The ethos of decentralization influences not just Aerodrome's technology and governance, but also how the protocol itself is funded and sustained. From day one, Aerodrome has operated without private investment or token sales. Instead, ongoing development and operations are funded through active participation in the protocol's revenue-sharing mechanics. This structure ensures complete alignment across all stakeholders, including core contributors.

The protocol maintains a dedicated, permanently max-locked voting position that has accumulated/accumulates veAERO from two distinct streams:

**Funding Streams:**

The protocol is sustained through two primary funding mechanisms:

- **Initial Allocation**: At launch, 19% of the initial supply of `AERO` was set aside as a funding source for future development. Because these tokens remain locked indefinitely, the working team's incentives are permanently aligned with the protocol's long-term health and growth. Individual team members did not receive vesting tokens.

- **Ongoing Emissions**: An ongoing allocation of 5% of weekly `AERO` emissions is directed to the DevCo address. These emissions help maintain the team's max-locked voting share in order to fund future development. All revenue is earned directly from protocol performance, just like all users without the need to sell any liquid tokens to either fund the team or attract external capital.

**Economic Alignment**

This unique structure ensures transparency and resilience. Contributors earn directly from protocol revenue under the same rules as all other users. As the protocol grows, available resources for development naturally expand; if revenues contract, funding proportionally adjusts. This eliminates privileged funding channels, ensuring all stakeholders share unified incentives to maximize long-term economic value.
