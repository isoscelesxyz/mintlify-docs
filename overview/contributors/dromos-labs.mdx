**About Dromos**

Dromos Labs builds essential infrastructure that gives users a greater stake in the new economy. It is the core contributing development company behind Aerodrome and Velodrome, the #1 decentralized exchanges on Base and the Optimism Superchain. By combining leading tech with economic innovation, Dromos designs better systems that deliver uncommon value.

## The MetaDEX

Dromos is the creator of the MetaDEX, the next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) model that underlies Velodrome and Aerodrome.

**MetaDEX Technology:**

MetaDEX technology includes:

- **Powerful and trusted AMMs**: MetaDEX01 brought constant-product and stable swap AMMs together. MetaDEX02 introduced Slipstream, an innovative take on concentrated liquidity that decoupled fees and tick-spacing and allowed for wider ranges and more strategic rewards streaming.

- **Modular architecture**: A flexible smart contract design enables faster iteration and seamless integration of new pool types as well as improved dynamic fee algorithms.

- **Integrated tools**: From native incentive functionality to automated vote optimization, the MetaDEX reduces the need for external systems that extract value.

**MetaDEX Economics:**

The MetaDEX model is built on three key economic principles:

- **Maximum token utility**: The native token of a MetaDEX represents a claim to 100% of future protocol revenue. It is not a glorified memecoin or empty governance tool.

- **Ownership aligned with participation**: The MetaDEX's perpetual emissions schedule allows for the weekly shifting of power (and value capture) to reward only those who actively contribute to the ecosystem. Only with perpetual emissions can a system reduce privilege based on tenure or status to incentivize long-term commitment and active participation.

- **Vote-lock governance**: The MetaDEX distributes revenue only to users who have demonstrated long-term commitment to the health of the protocol, thus creating total alignment and minimizing any incentive to drive short-term personal gain at the expense of the system.

**MetaDEX Advantages:**

The MetaDEX model provides traders with low-slippage swaps and helps protocols efficiently create deep liquidity for their tokens. Key advantages include:

- **Replace intermediaries**: Immutable code and trustless operations replace traditional intermediaries.
- **Decentralized governance**: Token-holders direct emissions through decentralized governance, ensuring liquidity is incentivized effectively and sustainably.
- **Aligned value distribution**: Returns 100% of the economic value generated to voters, aligning incentives across all stakeholders.
- **Community-funded development**: Development and operations are funded exclusively through participation rather than private sales or centralized funding, ensuring team alignment with the broader community.

The MetaDEX exemplifies DeFi's original promise: a decentralized, permissionless, and economically aligned ecosystem built around genuine token utility, open ownership, and transparent value distribution.

The MetaDEX model is an evolution of the ve(3,3) model pioneered by Andre Cronje. It includes trusted AMM designs popularized by Uniswap and Curve Finance along with additional native tools. For more on the MetaDEX, read the Dromos blog.

**Funding**

The ethos of decentralization influences not just Aerodrome's technology and governance, but also how the protocol itself is funded and sustained. From day one, Aerodrome has operated without private investment or token sales. Instead, ongoing development and operations are funded through active participation in the protocol's revenue-sharing mechanics. This structure ensures complete alignment across all stakeholders, including core contributors.

The protocol maintains a dedicated, permanently max-locked voting position that has accumulated/accumulates veAERO from two distinct streams:

**Funding Streams:**

The protocol is sustained through two primary funding mechanisms:

- **Initial Allocation**: At launch, 19% of the initial supply of `AERO` was set aside as a funding source for future development. Because these tokens remain locked indefinitely, the working team's incentives are permanently aligned with the protocol's long-term health and growth. Individual team members did not receive vesting tokens.

- **Ongoing Emissions**: An ongoing allocation of 5% of weekly `AERO` emissions is directed to the devco address. These emissions help maintain the team's max-locked voting share in order to fund future development. All revenue is earned directly from protocol performance, just like all users without the need to sell any liquid tokens to either fund the team or attract external capital.

**Alignment Through Aligned Economics**

This unique structure ensures transparency and resilience. Contributors earn directly from protocol revenue under the same rules as all other users. As the protocol grows, available resources for development naturally expand; if revenues contract, funding proportionally adjusts. This eliminates privileged funding channels, ensuring all stakeholders share unified incentives to maximize long-term economic value.
