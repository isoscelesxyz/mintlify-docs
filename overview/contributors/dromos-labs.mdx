## About Dromos

Dromos Labs builds essential infrastructure that gives all participants a greater stake in the new economy. It is the core contributing development company behind Aerodrome and Velodrome, the leading decentralized exchanges on Base and the Optimism Superchain. By combining leading tech with economic innovation, Dromos designs better systems that deliver uncommon value.

## The MetaDEX

Dromos is the creator of the MetaDEX, the next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) operating system that underlies Velodrome and Aerodrome.

The MetaDEX exemplifies DeFi’s original promise: a decentralized, permissionless, and economically aligned ecosystem built around genuine token utility, open ownership, and transparent value distribution.

<Note>
  The MetaDEX model is an evolution of the ve(3,3) model pioneered by [Andre
  Cronje](https://x.com/AndreCronjeTech). It includes trusted AMM designs popularized by Uniswap and Curve Finance along with additional native tools. For more on the MetaDEX, read the [Dromos
  blog](https://blog.dromos.xyz/).

## Funding

The ethos of decentralization influences not just technology, but also how the products Dromos contributes to are funded and sustained. From day one, both Aerodrome and Velodrome have operated without private investment or token sales. Instead, ongoing development and operations are funded through active participation in the protocol’s revenue-sharing mechanics. This structure ensures complete alignment across all stakeholders, including contributors.

The protocol maintains a dedicated, permanently max-locked voting position that has accumulated/accumulates veAERO from two distinct streams:

- ### Initial Allocation

  At launch, 19% of the initial supply of AERO was set aside as a funding source for future development. Because these tokens remain locked indefinitely, the working team’s incentives are permanently aligned with the protocol’s long-term health and growth. Individual team members did not receive vesting tokens.
- ### Ongoing Emissions

  An ongoing allocation of 5% of weekly AERO emissions is directed to the devco address. These emissions help maintain the team’s max-locked voting share in order to fund future development. All revenue is earned directly from protocol performance, just like all users without the need to sell any liquid tokens to either fund the team or attract external capital

This unique structure ensures transparency and resilience. Contributors earn directly from protocol revenue under the same rules as all other users. As the protocol grows, available resources for development naturally expand; if revenues contract, funding proportionally adjusts. This eliminates privileged funding channels, ensuring all stakeholders share unified incentives to maximize long-term economic value.
