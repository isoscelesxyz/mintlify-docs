description: "Permissionless pool creation and liquidity locking for new token launches on Aerodrome"
---

Launch is Aerodrome's permissionless pool creation system that enables any project to launch liquidity pools with built-in locking mechanisms to demonstrate long-term commitment.

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a pool for a new token, choose the right pool type, set initial pricing, configure liquidity locks, and navigate the path from emerging pool to full protocol integration with gauge voting.

## What is Aero Launch?

Launch provides a streamlined interface for creating liquidity pools on Aerodrome without requiring permission or approval. Projects can:

- **Create pools permissionlessly**: No approval needed to launch
- **Lock liquidity**: Signal commitment by locking LP tokens for a configurable duration
- **Choose pool types**: Select between V2 (full-range) or CL (concentrated) pools
- **Set initial pricing**: Establish the starting price for new tokens
- **Graduate to gauges**: Eligible pools can transition to earning `AERO` emissions

**Difference from Aero Ignition**:

- **Aero Ignition**: Curated, community-driven fair launches with structured price discovery
- **Aero Launch**: Open, permissionless pool creation with flexible lock durations

## Before you launch

Before creating a pool, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Token deployed on Base">
    Your token contract must be deployed and verified on Base network
  </Step>
  <Step title="Liquidity ready">
    Prepare both your token and the connector token (USDC, WETH, cbBTC, or AERO) for initial liquidity

    **Recommended minimum**: 1-2% of your token's <Tooltip tip="Fully Diluted Valuation - total supply multiplied by token price">FDV</Tooltip> in liquidity

  </Step>
  <Step title="Pool strategy decided">
    Determine your pool type (V2 vs CL) and lock duration based on your launch strategy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price determined">
    Calculate your target initial price for the token pair
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Liquidity locks are irreversible for the lock duration. Choose your lock period carefully based on
  your project timeline and commitment capacity.
</Warning>

## Choosing a pool type

The pool type you choose affects capital efficiency, management complexity, and user experience.

### V2 pools (Basic)

**How they work**: Liquidity spreads evenly across the entire price range (0 to infinity)

**Best for**:

- New tokens undergoing price discovery
- Tokens without active market makers
- Projects wanting "set and forget" liquidity management
- Teams new to concentrated liquidity mechanics

**Pool variants**:

- **Volatile**: For uncorrelated pairs (e.g., NEW_TOKEN/WETH)
- **Stable**: For correlated pairs (e.g., USDC/USDT, pegged tokens)

**Fee tiers**: Typically 0.3% for volatile, 0.01-0.05% for stable

### CL pools (Concentrated Liquidity)

**How they work**: Liquidity concentrated in specific price ranges for higher capital efficiency

**Best for**:

- Tokens with active market making teams
- Projects using automated liquidity management (like Autopilot)
- Established tokens with predictable price ranges
- Teams comfortable with active position management

**Requirements**:

- Active liquidity management to keep positions in range
- Minimum \$200,000-\$300,000 in connector token liquidity
- Understanding of tick ranges and rebalancing

**Fee tiers**: 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.30%, or 1.00% (choose based on volatility)

<Info>
  For most new token launches, **V2 volatile pools** are recommended. They require less active
  management and work better during initial price discovery phases.
</Info>

## Selecting a connector token

Your connector token determines trading routes and liquidity accessibility.

| Connector | Best for                         | Benefits                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **USDC**  | Stablecoin pairs, pricing in USD | Most liquid, clear USD valuation         |
| **WETH**  | Native crypto pairs, DeFi tokens | High volume, connects to major tokens    |
| **cbBTC** | Bitcoin-adjacent projects        | Access to BTC holders                    |
| **AERO**  | Protocol-aligned tokens          | Direct connection to Aerodrome ecosystem |

**Rule of thumb**: More correlated pairs (e.g., stablecoin/stablecoin) experience less <Tooltip tip="The difference between token value held vs simple hold strategy">impermanent loss</Tooltip> and tend to attract more sustainable liquidity.

## Setting initial price

Your initial price establishes the starting point for market discovery.

### How to calculate initial price

For a NEW_TOKEN/USDC pool:

1. **Determine target valuation**: What is your project's intended initial market cap?
2. **Calculate token price**: `Initial Price = Target Market Cap / Total Supply`
3. **Set pool ratio**: Deposit tokens in the ratio that achieves this price

**Example**:

- Target market cap: \$10M
- Total supply: 100M tokens
- Initial price: \$10M / 100M = \$0.10 per token
- For \$100k total liquidity: Deposit 500k tokens + \$50k USDC

### Price discovery considerations

<Warning>
  Initial price is not guaranteed. Market participants will immediately begin trading, potentially
  moving price significantly from your initial ratio.
</Warning>

**Best practices**:

- Set a **fair initial price** based on fundamentals, not speculation
- Avoid artificially high prices (leads to immediate selling pressure)
- Consider liquidity depth relative to expected volume
- Monitor first hours closely and be prepared for volatility

## How to launch a pool

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Liquidity page">
    Go to [aerodrome.finance/liquidity](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) and click "New Deposit"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select pool type">
    Choose between: - **V2 Volatile** (most new tokens) - **V2 Stable** (correlated pairs only) - **Concentrated Liquidity** (if you have active management)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select token pair">
    - Enter your token address (or select from list) - Choose connector token (USDC, WETH, cbBTC, or AERO) - Confirm pair doesn't already exist
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose fee tier">
    **For V2**: Automatic based on pool type (0.3% volatile, 0.05% stable)

    **For CL**: Select fee tier:

    - 0.01% - Stablecoins, highly correlated pairs
    - 0.05% - Less volatile pairs
    - 0.30% - Most volatile pairs (standard)
    - 1.00% - Very volatile or exotic pairs

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set initial liquidity amounts">
    Enter amounts for both tokens: - Ratio determines initial price - Minimum recommended: 1-2% of FDV

    - For CL pools: \$200k+ in connector token recommended

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure liquidity lock">
    **Lock duration options**:

    - **1 month**: Short-term liquidity test
    - **3-6 months**: Standard launch commitment
    - **1 year+**: Strong long-term signal

    Locked liquidity cannot be withdrawn until expiration.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and approve">
    - Review all parameters carefully - Approve both tokens for the pool contract - Confirm pool creation transaction
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add liquidity">
    After pool creation:

    - Deposit your prepared liquidity
    - Lock LP tokens for chosen duration
    - Transaction confirms your locked position

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Locked liquidity is visible to users and creates confidence in your project's commitment. Longer
  locks generally signal stronger dedication to the ecosystem.
</Info>

## Lock duration strategy

Your lock duration sends a signal to the market about your commitment level.

### Short-term (1-3 months)

**Use when**:

- Testing market demand before deeper commitment
- Planning rapid iteration on tokenomics
- Uncertain about long-term Base presence

**Market perception**: Lower commitment, higher risk for LPs

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

**Use when**:

- Standard new token launch
- Building initial community and traction
- Preparing for potential gauge listing

**Market perception**: Moderate commitment, standard for new launches

### Long-term (1 year+)

**Use when**:

- Strong conviction in long-term success
- Seeking gauge listing and emissions
- Want to signal maximum commitment to ecosystem

**Market perception**: High commitment, attracts long-term aligned LPs

<Tip>
  Many successful projects start with 6-12 month locks and extend them as they approach gauge
  eligibility. This demonstrates growing commitment over time.
</Tip>

## Post-launch actions

After launching your pool, focus on these key areas:

### 1. Community building and marketing

- **Announce the launch**: Share pool address and trading link
- **Engage on social media**: Build awareness on X, Discord, Telegram
- **Create trading guides**: Help users understand how to access your token
- **Monitor early trading**: Watch for unusual activity or issues

### 2. Deposit incentives (if listed)

Once your pool is listed, you can deposit incentives to attract veAERO votes:

- Review incentive caps (15x fees or 5% of connector token TVL)
- Deposit incentives to attract gauge votes
- Monitor vote share and adjust incentives accordingly
- Historical multiplier: \$1 in fees/incentives → ~1.5-2x in `AERO` emissions for LPs

### 3. Monitor pool health

Track these metrics:

- **Volume**: Daily trading volume indicates demand
- **Liquidity depth**: Total value locked in the pool
- **Price stability**: Volatility and price discovery progress
- **LP composition**: How much liquidity is from community vs team

### 4. Prepare for gauge eligibility

To qualify for a gauge (emissions-earning capability):

- Build trading volume (\$1M daily average over 30 days for DEX-only tokens)
- Demonstrate product-market fit and traction
- Engage with Aerodrome team about listing process
- Prepare to deposit incentives once listed

## Graduation to gauge voting

Pools that meet listing criteria can transition from emerging pools to full protocol integration.

### Listing requirements

**Minimum volume thresholds**:

- **DEX trading**: \$1M daily average over 30 days
- **CEX trading**: \$2M daily average over 30 days

**Additional factors evaluated**:

- Product-market fit and real usage
- Tokenomics and distribution quality
- Security audits and contract verification
- Overall ecosystem traction

### What changes after listing

**Before listing** (emerging pool):

- Trading fees accrue to LPs
- No `AERO` emissions available
- Cannot deposit on-platform incentives
- Can use third-party incentives (Merkl, Metrom)

**After listing** (gauged pool):

- LPs can stake positions to earn `AERO` emissions
- Project can deposit incentives directly
- Pool competes for weekly veAERO votes
- Access to protocol marketing support

### How to request a gauge

<Steps>
  <Step title="Meet volume requirements">Achieve \$1M+ daily volume average over 30 days</Step>
  <Step title="Engage with Aerodrome team">
    Reach out through official channels to begin listing discussions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide project information">
    Share details about your project, traction, security, and tokenomics
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete listing process">
    Work with team to complete evaluation and activate gauge
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pool creation transaction fails" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Common causes**:

    - Insufficient token approvals (approve both tokens)
    - Pool already exists for this pair/fee tier
    - Incorrect token addresses
    - Gas estimation failure

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify both tokens are approved for pool creation
    - Check if pool exists using pool explorer
    - Double-check token contract addresses
    - Try increasing gas limit manually

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I extend my liquidity lock after creation?" icon="clock">
    Lock extensions depend on the specific implementation. Generally, locks can be extended but not shortened. Check the pool details interface for extension options.

    If uncertain, assume locks cannot be modified and choose your duration carefully at creation time.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when my lock expires?" icon="unlock">
    When your liquidity lock expires:

    - LP tokens become withdrawable
    - You can remove liquidity from the pool
    - You can extend the lock for another period
    - You can leave liquidity unlocked if preferred

    Expiration does not automatically withdraw—you must manually claim unlocked LP tokens.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I unlock liquidity early in an emergency?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    No. Liquidity locks are smart contract-enforced and cannot be unlocked early, even in emergencies. This is by design to ensure credible commitment.

    **Plan accordingly**:

    - Only lock liquidity you can afford to have inaccessible
    - Choose lock durations conservatively
    - Maintain separate unlocked liquidity for flexibility

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My pool isn't showing in the UI" icon="eye-slash">
    Newly created pools may take a few minutes to appear in the interface.

    **To verify your pool**:

    - Check the transaction on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org)
    - Note the pool address from transaction logs
    - Use direct pool address to interact if needed
    - Wait 5-10 minutes for indexing to complete

    If pool doesn't appear after 1 hour, contact Aerodrome support.
