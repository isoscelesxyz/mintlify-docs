<Warning>
  **Most users will never interact with the incentive function** on Aerodrome. Incentives are almost always deposited by protocols with the aim of encouraging voting for a specific pool as a way to attract votes/emissions that will then attract liquidity providers.

If you're a user looking to _claim_ rewards from voting, see [Claim Rewards](/overview/core-features/rewards).

</Warning>

  **TODO** Decide if we want to keep things simple with a description and instructions for getting
  in touch or include some starter content like the following.

## What are voting incentives?

Voting incentives are rewards that protocols deposit to encourage veAERO holders to vote for their liquidity pools. When veAERO holders vote for your pool, it receives a larger share of weekly <Tooltip tip="AERO tokens distributed weekly to liquidity providers based on gauge votes">AERO emissions</Tooltip>, which attracts more liquidity providers.

### The incentive flywheel

1. **Protocol deposits incentives** → Attracts veAERO voters
2. **Voters direct emissions** → Pool receives `AERO` rewards
3. **Higher rewards** → Attracts liquidity providers
4. **Deeper liquidity** → Better trading experience
5. **More trading volume** → More fees for voters

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where incentives drive liquidity, which drives volume, which justifies more incentives.

<Warning>
  Incentive spending should align with your protocol's liquidity needs and budget. Unsustainable
  incentive programs can create mercenary liquidity that disappears when incentives stop. Plan for
  long-term liquidity sustainability.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

Before depositing incentives, ensure you have:

- Understanding of which pool(s) need liquidity
- Tokens allocated for incentive spending
- ROI framework to measure incentive effectiveness
- Understanding of [voting mechanics](/overview/core-features/vote) and [emissions](/overview/tokenomics/overview)

## Incentive strategy considerations

### Token choice

Different tokens work better for different goals:

- **Protocol tokens**: Build token holder base, grow community
- **Stablecoins (USDC, USDT)**: Attract professional voters, predictable costs
- **`AERO tokens`**: Attract long-term aligned voters, bootstrap veAERO positions

### Timing

- **Launch phase**: Heavy incentives to bootstrap initial liquidity
- **Growth phase**: Moderate incentives to maintain competitiveness
- **Maturity phase**: Reduced incentives as organic volume grows

### ROI calculation

Track these metrics to measure incentive effectiveness:

- Cost per dollar of liquidity attracted
- Incentive spend vs. trading volume generated
- Incentive spend vs. emissions received
- Liquidity retention after incentives stop

## Incentive best practices

**Consistency over bursts**: Steady, predictable incentives attract more reliable liquidity than sporadic large incentives.

**Multi-epoch commitments**: Announce incentive plans for multiple epochs to build voter confidence.

**Diversify token types**: Mix protocol tokens with stablecoins to attract different voter segments.

**Monitor competition**: Track incentive rates on competing pools to stay competitive.

**Build relationships**: Engage with large veAERO holders and voting protocols directly.

<Tip>
  Many successful protocols commit to incentive programs spanning 4-12 epochs (1-3 months) to
  demonstrate long-term commitment and attract stable liquidity.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's a good incentive rate?">
    Competitive incentive rates vary by market conditions. As a baseline, track the ratio of
    incentive value to emissions value on similar pools. Aim for 50-150% of the emissions value as a
    starting point, then adjust based on results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I use my protocol token or stablecoins?">
    Protocol tokens help build community, but may have variable value.
    Stablecoins provide predictable costs and attract professional voters. Many protocols use a mix
    of both.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I measure ROI on incentives?">
    Compare your incentive spend to: (1) liquidity attracted, (2) trading volume generated, and (3)
    emissions received. If you spend $100k in incentives to receive $150k in emissions value, that's
    a 1.5x return before considering volume benefits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should I reduce or stop incentives?">
    Reduce incentives when organic volume can sustain liquidity without subsidies, or when ROI drops
    below your threshold. Test gradual reductions rather than stopping abruptly to avoid liquidity
    flight.
