Aerodrome is the essential trading hub and liquidity marketplace of Base, the fastest-growing layer 2 on the Ethereum blockchain. As a <Tooltip tip="Decentralized Exchange - a platform for trading tokens without a central authority">DEX</Tooltip>, its core function is to facilitate low-fee swaps for a wide variety of tokens. These swaps are made possible by users who provide liquidity to earn rewards. For builders and token issuers, Aerodrome is the DEX of choice for creating efficient, liquid markets for their tokens.

**Aerodrome was launched on Base on August 28, 2023.**

100% of protocol revenue\* is distributed to token operators as voting rewards.

<Note>
  *Protocol revenue is all swap fees generated by staked liquidity + all incentives deposited + 10%
  of fees generated by unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible CL pools

## Why Aerodrome

### Built decentralized

Aerodrome is built in the true spirit of decentralized finance (DeFi), with immutable code and permissionless functions. The front end is maximally decentralized, without any centralized APIs or dependencies. Operations are directed by the <Link href="/overview/contributors/aerodrome-foundation">Aerodrome Foundation</Link>, a neutral steward of the protocol, and executed by <Link href="/overview/contributors/dromos-labs">Dromos Labs</Link>.

### Launched clean

Aerodrome was designed as a public good for the Base ecosystem. Its creation was entirely self-bootstrapped, without any private funding or token sales. Ongoing development is funded exclusively through participation in the system along with the revenue captured by a 5% team allocation of weekly AERO emissions.

### Optimized for flight

Aerodrome is built for sustainability, unifying the top-performing AMM models in DeFi with innovative features and a durable economic system that attracts and retains deep liquidity. Aerodrome maintains long-term stakeholder alignment by distributing 100% of protocol revenue to token-holders who lock to participate in weekly voting.

## Aerodrome provides three core functions

### Swap Tokens

Users can trade tokens like BTC, ETH, or AERO for low fees and at reliable exchange rates. The tokens users swap for are not provided by a centralized authority like a bank, but by other users who deposit liquidity, making trading possible.

### Deposit and Earn

Users who want to earn yield can deposit tokens into Aerodrome’s liquidity pools. By default, they then earn a portion of swap fees from that pool. To take full advantage of the system, LPs can “stake” their liquidity and earn AERO emissions instead. That AERO can then be locked as veAERO (enabling the holder to vote and earn a portion of future protocol revenue).

### Create a Market

Protocols and token issuers can launch liquid markets for new and existing tokens permissionlessly, both by depositing protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and by incentivizing veAERO voters to direct emissions to a pool, attracting additional liquidity providers

## The MetaDEX Flywheel

As a decentralized alternative to traditional systems, a DEX must have thoughtfully designed mechanics that align the interests of a wide-ranging stakeholder group:

- Swappers who want low-slippage swaps
- Liquidity Providers who want steady rewards
- Tokenholders who want exposure to protocol growth

Legacy DEXs often fail to meet the needs of all three groups, leading to inevitable friction.

The MetaDEX, the next-generation DEX model that underlies Aerodrome, solves this problem with leading technology and economic innovation.

In a MetaDEX, 100% of protocol revenue is distributed as voting rewards to tokenholders who vote to direct new token emissions. LPs are then rewarded with those emissions, the value of which can often outpace weekly fees. This steady stream of LP rewards helps retain liquidity, which in turn maintains optimal trading conditions for swappers.

These mechanics help maintain ecosystem balance and structurally aligns all stakeholders in the direction of maintaining long-term growth:

## Core Design

### <Tooltip tip="Automated Market Makers - algorithms that govern liquidity pools and pricing">AMMs</Tooltip>

Aerodrome supports liquidity pools governed by multiple powerful and trusted AMM models. By providing diverse options all on one platform, Aerodrome helps ensure optimal trading conditions for a wide range of assets and market scenarios.

### Integrated Management Features

Aerodrome includes integrated features that allow users to automate voting and securely lock tokens natively, without reliance on external services or intermediaries that can extract value from the system.

### Long-term Alignment

Aerodrome’s economic design aligns rewards with participation. These immutable mechanics encourage behaviors that benefit the entire ecosystem and help ensure the protocol’s long-term stability.

### Pool Gauges

Gauges are activated only for liquidity pools that signal authentic trading potential. Once a pool has a gauge it qualifies for emissions (meaning it is eligible to receive votes).

### Incentive Engine

Aerodrome’s flywheel makes it easy to bootstrap liquidity, using incentives to attract voters who direct token emissions that then attract LPs.

### Vote-lock Governance

Aerodrome uses a vote-lock governance model that empowers tokenholders to lock tokens to shape platform decisions and outcomes, and claim a share of protocol revenue.

## Epochs

Aerodrome operates on “epochs,” seven-day periods starting every Thursday at 00:00 UTC and ending the following Wednesday at 23:59 UTC.

At the end of each epoch, liquidity providers (LPs) receive AERO token emissions proportional to the votes the pools where they have staked deposits received. Only LPs with staked liquidity receive emissions. LPs with unstaked liquidity earn a portion of swap fees instead. Of fees earned with unstaked concentrated liquidity in emissions-eligible pools, 10% is taken each week and distributed along with other fees and incentives as voting rewards.

veAERO Voters are rewarded (proportionally to their voting power) with trading fees from the previous epoch and any additional voting incentives from the current epoch.
