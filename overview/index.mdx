This overview explains what Aerodrome is, how it differs from traditional DEXs, and why the MetaDEX model matters. This page is for anyone new to Aerodrome who wants to understand its core design.

## What is Aerodrome?

Aerodrome is a <Tooltip tip="Decentralized Exchange - a platform for trading tokens without a central authority">DEX</Tooltip> on Base that uses the MetaDEX model to align the interests of traders, <Tooltip tip="Users who deposit tokens to enable trading">liquidity providers</Tooltip>, and tokenholders.

Launched on Base on August 28, 2023, Aerodrome enables low-fee token swaps through deep, sustainable liquidity powered by innovative economic design.

## What is a MetaDEX?

Traditional DEXs face a fundamental alignment problem:
- **Traders** want low fees and minimal <Tooltip tip="Unexpected price changes during a trade">slippage</Tooltip>
- **Liquidity providers** want high rewards for depositing tokens
- **Tokenholders** want value capture from protocol growth

Most DEXs prioritize one group at the expense of others, or keep protocol revenue for the team/treasury.

**The MetaDEX model solves this by distributing 100% of protocol revenue to veAERO voters** who actively direct token <Tooltip tip="Weekly AERO token distributions to liquidity providers">emissions</Tooltip> to liquidity pools.

<Info>
Protocol revenue includes:
- All swap fees from staked liquidity
- All voting incentives (bribes)
- 10% of fees from unstaked concentrated liquidity pools
</Info>

This creates sustainable alignment where every stakeholder benefits from protocol growth.

## How the MetaDEX Flywheel Works

The MetaDEX model creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Votes direct emissions">
    veAERO holders vote weekly to direct `AERO` token emissions to liquidity pools
  </Step>
  <Step title="Emissions attract liquidity">
    Liquidity providers stake in pools with high emissions to earn `AERO` rewards
  </Step>
  <Step title="Liquidity enables efficient swaps">
    Deep liquidity means traders get better prices with minimal slippage
  </Step>
  <Step title="Swaps generate fees">
    Trading activity generates swap fees that become protocol revenue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revenue attracts votes">
    100% of fees (plus bribes) go to voters, who continue voting for high-volume pools
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each step reinforces the next, creating durable liquidity and sustainable growth.

## Key Differences from Traditional DEXs

| Traditional DEX | Aerodrome (MetaDEX) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Team/treasury keeps protocol revenue | 100% revenue to voters |
| Passive tokenholder value capture | Active participation required (voting) |
| LPs chase yields across platforms | Emissions provide stable rewards |
| Misaligned incentives | Unified flywheel aligns all stakeholders |

## How Aerodrome Works

### For Traders
Swap tokens with competitive rates enabled by deep, sustainable liquidity. Aerodrome supports a wide variety of tokens on Base with low fees and reliable exchange rates.

### For Liquidity Providers
Deposit tokens to earn swap fees or stake for `AERO` emissions. Lock earned `AERO` as veAERO to participate in governance and earn protocol revenue.

### For Tokenholders (veAERO holders)
Vote to direct emissions and earn 100% of protocol revenue as rewards. The longer you lock `AERO`, the more voting power you receive.

### For Protocols
Bootstrap liquidity by depositing incentives (bribes) to attract veAERO votes. Create permissionless markets for new and existing tokens.

## Built for Sustainability

### Decentralized Infrastructure
Aerodrome is built with immutable smart contracts and permissionless functions. The front end is maximally decentralized, without centralized APIs or dependencies.

### Fair Launch
Aerodrome was designed as a public good for the Base ecosystem. Its creation was entirely self-bootstrapped, without private funding or token sales. Development is funded through participation in the system and a 5% team allocation of weekly `AERO` emissions.

### Long-term Alignment
Aerodrome's economic design aligns rewards with participation. These immutable mechanics encourage behaviors that benefit the entire ecosystem and ensure the protocol's long-term stability.

## Technical Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How epochs work">
    Aerodrome operates on seven-day <Tooltip tip="7-day periods starting Thursday 00:00 UTC and ending Wednesday 23:59 UTC">epochs</Tooltip>. At the end of each epoch:

    - LPs with staked liquidity receive `AERO` emissions proportional to the votes their pools received
    - veAERO voters receive swap fees from the previous epoch and bribes from the current epoch
    - All protocol activities (voting, distributions, governance) align with this weekly schedule

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pool types and AMMs">
    Aerodrome supports multiple <Tooltip tip="Automated Market Maker - algorithms that govern liquidity pools and pricing">AMM</Tooltip> models:

    - **Basic pools**: UniV2-style and Curve-style constant-product pools for general-purpose liquidity
    - **Concentrated liquidity (Slipstream)**: UniV3-inspired pools with enhancements like decoupled tick spacing and native reward streaming

    Both pool types can be "stable" (for correlated assets) or "volatile" (for uncorrelated assets).

    Learn more in [Pool Types](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/index).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Governance and vote-locking">
    To participate in governance, users lock `AERO` tokens to receive veAERO (vote-escrowed AERO).

    - Lock duration: 1 week to 4 years
    - Longer locks = more voting power
    - veAERO holders receive rebases weekly to reduce dilution
    - Locked tokens cannot be unlocked early

    Learn more in [Lock](/overview/core-features/lock) and [Vote](/overview/core-features/vote).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gauges and incentives">
    <Tooltip tip="Clearing houses for pool-specific activity including votes, fees, and incentives">Gauges</Tooltip> are activated only for liquidity pools that signal authentic trading potential. Once a pool has a gauge, it qualifies for emissions.

    Protocols can deposit incentives (bribes) into gauges to attract veAERO votes and bootstrap liquidity for their tokens.
