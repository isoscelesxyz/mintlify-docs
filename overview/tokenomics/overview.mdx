## In this concept

This page explains Aerodrome's token structure and economics for anyone participating in the protocol. You'll learn how `AERO` and veAERO work together, how voting power is calculated, and how tokens were initially distributed.

**Primary audience**: DeFi participants, veAERO holders, and protocol teams evaluating Aerodrome

To ensure maximal stakeholder alignment, Aerodrome puts its native token at the center of protocol mechanics, distributing 100% of revenue to users who lock it for voting power. Because of this, the token represents not just superficial governance rights, but a functional claim on the future productive capacity of the protocol.

`AERO` serves a dual role: it's distributed as **rewards** to liquidity providers through emissions, and provides **utility** when locked for governance and voting power. This design aligns incentives across all participants—LPs earn `AERO`, then lock it to become voters who direct future emissions.

**Token Structure:**

- **`AERO`** - ERC-20 utility token
- **veAERO** - ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT (the locked form of `AERO`)

Each week, new `AERO` is minted and distributed to liquidity providers through a process called <Tooltip tip="Weekly distribution of newly minted AERO tokens to liquidity pools based on gauge votes">emissions</Tooltip>.

**Creating veAERO:**

veAERO is created by <Tooltip tip="Locking tokens for a specified period to gain voting rights and rewards">vote-escrowing</Tooltip> (locking) `AERO`. It is sometimes referred to as a "Lock" or veNFT. Additional tokens can be added to a veAERO NFT at any time.

**Lock Period and Voting Power:**

The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period, hence the "ve" prefix) can be up to four years. The longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight) of the underlying locked balance, following the linear relationship below:

- 100 `AERO` locked for 4 years → 100 veAERO
- 100 `AERO` locked for 1 year → 25 veAERO

**Auto-Max Lock:**

Aerodrome Locks (veNFTs) can be set into Auto-Max Lock mode. In this mode, the protocol treats them as perpetually locked for the maximum duration of four years, and their voting power does not decay. The Auto-Max Lock feature can be toggled on and off for each Lock (veNFT).

## Initial Distribution

| AERO                         | Amount | Percentage |
| :--------------------------- | -----: | ---------: |
| Voter Incentives             |    40M |         8% |
| Genesis Liquidity Incentives |    10M |         2% |

| veAERO                                     | Amount | Percentage |
| :----------------------------------------- | -----: | ---------: |
| Airdrop for veVELO Lockers                 |   200M |        40% |
| Public Goods Fund (Auto Max-Locked)        |   105M |        21% |
| Development Team Funding (Auto Max-Locked) |    95M |        19% |
| Flight School (Auto Max-Locked)            |    50M |        10% |
