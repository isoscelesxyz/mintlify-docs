Aerodrome's AERO token is engineered to align economic incentives across all stakeholders—traders, liquidity providers (LPs), and tokenholders—by embedding the native token at the core of protocol value capture:

- **Tokenholders**<br />
  Aerodrome captures and directs 100% of protocol revenue to veAERO holders in the form of voting rewards, giving lockers a direct economic claim on value creation and long-term growth.
- **Liquidity Providers**<br />
  LPs receive AERO emissions that are allocated by veAERO voters to pools where liquidity is most productive, sustaining depth while allowing incentives to adjust as markets mature.
- **Traders**<br />
  Deep, consistently incentivized liquidity enables tighter spreads, lower slippage that results in better execution for traders, which generate fee revenue for veAERO voters by routing through Aerodrome pools.

AERO represents a functional claim on protocol revenue and productive capacity, incentivizing long-term participation and reinforcing sustainable liquidity depth.

## Core Mechanics: Tokens, Locks, and Weekly Emissions

Aerodrome&rsquo;s system is designed around two token types and a weekly emission cycle.

## Token Structure

Aerodrome uses two tokens, one fungible and the other non-fungible:

- `AERO` [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) — The liquid utility token of the protocol.
- `veAERO` [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) — The governance token, represented as an NFT.

`veAERO` is created by vote-escrowing (locking) AERO. AERO tokens can be added to a `veAERO` NFT at any time.

The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period) can be up to four years. The longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight) of the underlying locked balance, following a linear relationship, for example:

- 100 `AERO` locked for 4 years will become 100 `veAERO`
- 100 `AERO` locked for 1 year will become 25 `veAERO`

`veAERO` locks can be set into Auto-Max Lock, which are treated by the protocol as being perpetually locked for the maximum duration of four years, and their voting power does not decay. The Auto-Max Lock feature can be turned on and off for each Lock (`veNFT`).

## Initial Distribution

| :--------------------------- | -----: | ---------: |
| Voter Incentives             |    40M |         8% |
| Genesis Liquidity Incentives |    10M |         2% |

| `veAERO`                                   | Amount | Percentage |
| :----------------------------------------- | -----: | ---------: |
| Airdrop for `veVELO` Lockers               |   200M |        40% |
| Public Goods Fund (Auto Max-Locked)        |   105M |        21% |
| Development Team Funding (Auto Max-Locked) |    95M |        19% |
| Flight School (Auto Max-Locked)            |    50M |        10% |

## Weekly Emission Cycle

Each epoch (week), Aerodrome runs a repeatable incentive loop that ties emissions, liquidity, trading fees, and governance:

1. **Emissions**<br />
   At the start of each epoch, a predetermined amount of AERO is minted as that epoch&rsquo;s emissions.
2. **Vote**<br />
   veAERO holders vote on which pools should receive emissions. In return, voters receive 100% of the economic value captured by the pools they vote for in the epoch. Emissions are allocated across pools proportionally to the votes they receive.
3. **LPs Compete for Emissions**<br />
   LPs can provide liquidity to the voted pools and stake their positions to earn AERO. Emissions are earned pro rata, meaning rewards scale with the amount of eligible liquidity provided (subject to each pool&rsquo;s mechanics).
4. **Trading Fees**<br />
   As swaps occur, trading fees accrue to each pool during the week. At the end of the epoch, accrued fees are deposited into the pool&rsquo;s gauge as voting rewards.
5. **Protocol Incentives**<br />
   Protocols can supplement trading fees with external incentives (for example, their native tokens). These incentives increase the total rewards available to veAERO voters, helping attract votes and bootstrap liquidity during growth phases.

This process creates a Reinforcement Loop (Flywheel): pools that generate higher rewards attract more votes the following week. More votes drive more emissions, which attract more liquidity, improve execution, and can increase volume and fees.

## Emissions Schedule

Weekly AERO emissions are currently set at approximately 11% annualized inflation, as determined by [the Aero Fed](https://x.com/AerodromeFi/status/1983957942929125679). This level is intended to balance competitive liquidity incentives with long-term sustainability.

Emissions followed an initial schedule that ramped up during an early growth phase, followed by a gradual decay as the protocol matured and organic trading activity increased. This transition reflects Aerodrome&rsquo;s shift from liquidity bootstrapping toward maintaining deep, efficient markets with lower marginal inflation.

Today, emissions function as a calibrated coordination tool, sufficient to sustain liquidity and reinforce productive markets, while avoiding the excessive dilution.

## Rebase

veAERO holders receive a rebase proportional to AERO emissions and to the ratio of veAERO to AERO supply, reducing vote power dilution for veAERO.

The weekly rebase amount is calculated with the following formula:

<Latex>rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalSupply)^2 × 0.5</Latex>

This rebase formula will reward `veAERO` holders most when locking rates decrease, incentivizing new lockers to step in. `veAERO` supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers.
