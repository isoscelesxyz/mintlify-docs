To ensure maximal stakeholder alignment, Aerodrome puts its native token at the center of protocol mechanics, distributing 100% of revenue to users who lock it for voting power. Because of this, the token represents not just superficial governance rights, but a functional claim on the future productive capacity of the protocol.

## Token Structure

Aerodrome uses two tokens, one fungible and the other non-fungible:

- `AERO` — [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) utility token
- `veAERO` — [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) governance token in the form of an NFT (the locked form of `AERO`)

## Locking, Voting, and Emissions

Each week, new `AERO` is automatically minted and distributed to liquidity providers (a process called “emissions”).

`veAERO` is created by vote-escrowing (locking) `AERO`. It is sometimes referred to as a “Lock” or veNFT. Additional tokens can be added to a `veAERO` NFT at any time.

The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period, hence the “ve” prefix) can be up to four years. The longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight) of the underlying locked balance, following the linear relationship shown below:

- 100 `AERO` locked for 4 years will become 100 `veAERO`
- 100 `AERO` locked for 1 year will become 25 `veAERO`

Additionally, Aerodrome Locks (veNFTs) can be set into Auto-Max Lock, which are treated by the protocol as being perpetually locked for the maximum duration of four years, and their voting power does not decay. The Auto-Max Lock feature can be turned on and off for each Lock (veNFT).

## Initial Distribution

| `AERO`                       | Amount | Percentage |
| :--------------------------- | -----: | ---------: |
| Voter Incentives             |    40M |         8% |
| Genesis Liquidity Incentives |    10M |         2% |

| `veAERO`                                   | Amount | Percentage |
| :----------------------------------------- | -----: | ---------: |
| Airdrop for `veVELO` Lockers               |   200M |        40% |
| Public Goods Fund (Auto Max-Locked)        |   105M |        21% |
| Development Team Funding (Auto Max-Locked) |    95M |        19% |
| Flight School (Auto Max-Locked)            |    50M |        10% |

## Emissions

The initial supply of `AERO` was 500M, with 450M distributed as vote-locked (`veAERO`) tokens.

Weekly emissions began at 10M `AERO` (2% of the initial supply). The emission schedule was broken into three phases:

### Take-off

During the first 14 weeks (epochs), emissions increased at 3% per week, allowing for rapid growth in protocol activity and partner onboarding.

### Cruise

After Epoch 14, emissions decayed at 1% per epoch, ensuring total supply inflation decreased over time as the protocol matured.

### AERO Fed

When emissions programmatically dropped under 9M per epoch, a transition period began which is designed to end in `veAERO` voters taking control of Aerodrome's monetary policy through the AERO Fed system, determining each epoch one of three outcomes:

- **Increase emissions** by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
- **Decrease emissions** by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
- **Maintain emissions** unchanged as a % of total supply

The winning vote will be determined by simple majority. If an Increase or Decrease is selected, the emission rate will change one full epoch after the vote. A max emission rate will be set at 1% of total supply per week (52% annualized) and a minimum rate at 0.01% per week (0.52% annualized).

### Rebase

veAERO holders receive a rebase proportional to AERO emissions and to the ratio of veAERO to AERO supply, reducing vote power dilution for veAERO.

The weekly rebase amount is calculated with the following formula:

<Latex>
  rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalSupply)^2 × 0.5
</Latex>

This rebase formula will reward `veAERO` holders most when locking rates decrease, incentivizing new lockers to step in. `veAERO` supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers.
