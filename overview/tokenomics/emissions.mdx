## In this concept

This page is for **veAERO holders, protocol teams, and anyone evaluating Aerodrome's tokenomics**. You'll learn how new `AERO` tokens are created and distributed over time, the three phases of emissions, how the AERO Fed works, and how rebases protect veAERO holders from dilution.

The initial supply of `AERO` was 500M, with 450M distributed as vote-locked (veAERO) tokens.

Weekly <Tooltip tip="Newly minted AERO tokens distributed to liquidity pools each epoch">emissions</Tooltip> began at 10M `AERO` (2% of the initial supply). The emission schedule follows three phases:

**Emission Phases:**

- **Take-off**: During the first 14 weeks (epochs), emissions increased at 3% per week, enabling rapid growth in protocol activity and partner onboarding.

- **Cruise**: After Epoch 14, emissions decayed at 1% per epoch, ensuring total supply inflation decreased over time as the protocol matured.

- **AERO Fed**: When emissions programmatically dropped below 9M per epoch, a transition period began designed to transfer control of Aerodrome's monetary policy to veAERO voters through the AERO Fed system. Each epoch, voters determine one of three outcomes:
  - **Increase emissions** by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
  - **Decrease emissions** by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
  - **Maintain emissions** unchanged as a % of total supply

The winning vote is determined by simple majority. If an Increase or Decrease is selected, the emission rate changes one full epoch after the vote.

The maximum emission rate is capped at **1% of total supply per week** (52% annualized), and the minimum rate is set at **0.01% per week** (0.52% annualized).

## Rebase

veAERO holders receive a <Tooltip tip="Additional AERO tokens distributed to veAERO holders to offset voting power dilution">rebase</Tooltip> proportional to `AERO` emissions and the ratio of veAERO to `AERO` supply. This mechanism reduces vote power dilution for long-term lockers.

**Rebase Formula:**

The weekly rebase amount is calculated as:

```
rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalSupply)^2 × 0.5
```

Where:
- `weeklyEmissions` = Total `AERO` minted in the current epoch
- `veAERO.totalSupply` = Total locked veAERO supply
- `AERO.totalSupply` = Total `AERO` token supply

The rebase formula rewards veAERO holders most when locking rates decrease, incentivizing new participants to lock tokens. Note that veAERO supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers through gauges—rebases are separate from gauge emissions.
