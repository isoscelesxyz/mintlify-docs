The initial supply of AERO was 500M, with 450M distributed as vote-locked (veAERO) tokens.

Weekly emissions began at 10M AERO (2% of the initial supply). The emission schedule was broken into three phases:

**Take-off:** During the first 14 weeks (epochs), emissions increased at 3% per week, allowing for rapid growth in protocol activity and partner onboarding.

**Cruise**: After Epoch 14, emissions decayed at 1% per epoch, ensuring total supply inflation decreased over time as the protocol matured.

**AERO Fed:** When emissions programmatically dropped under 9M per epoch, a transition period began which is designed to end in veAERO voters taking control of Aerodrome's monetary policy through the AERO Fed system, determining each epoch one of three outcomes:

Increase emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
Decrease emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
Maintain emissions unchanged as a % of total supply

The winning vote will be determined by simple majority. If an Increase or Decrease is selected, the emission rate will change one full epoch after the vote. A max emission rate will be set at 1% of total supply per week (52% annualized) and a minimum rate at 0.01% per week (0.52% annualized).

## Rebase

veAERO holders receive a rebase proportional to AERO emissions and to the ratio of veAERO to AERO supply, reducing vote power dilution for veAERO.

The weekly rebase amount is calculated with the following formula:

_rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalsupply)^2 × 0.5_

This rebase formula will reward veAERO holders most when locking rates decrease, incentivizing new lockers to step in. veAERO supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers.
