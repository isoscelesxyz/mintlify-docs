The initial supply of `AERO` was 500M, with 450M distributed as vote-locked (veAERO) tokens.

Weekly emissions began at 10M `AERO` (2% of the initial supply). The emission schedule follows three phases:

**Emission Phases:**

- **Take-off**: During the first 14 weeks (epochs), emissions increased at 3% per week, enabling rapid growth in protocol activity and partner onboarding.

- **Cruise**: After Epoch 14, emissions decayed at 1% per epoch, ensuring total supply inflation decreased over time as the protocol matured.

- **AERO Fed**: When emissions programmatically dropped below 9M per epoch, a transition period began designed to transfer control of Aerodrome's monetary policy to veAERO voters through the AERO Fed system. Each epoch, voters determine one of three outcomes:
  - **Increase emissions** by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
  - **Decrease emissions** by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
  - **Maintain emissions** unchanged as a % of total supply

The winning vote will be determined by simple majority. If an Increase or Decrease is selected, the emission rate will change one full epoch after the vote.

<Info>
The maximum emission rate is capped at 1% of total supply per week (52% annualized), and the minimum rate is set at 0.01% per week (0.52% annualized).

## Rebase

veAERO holders receive a rebase proportional to `AERO` emissions and the ratio of veAERO to `AERO` supply. This mechanism reduces vote power dilution for long-term lockers.

**Rebase Formula:**

<Info>
The weekly rebase amount is calculated using the formula below:

_rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalsupply)^2 × 0.5_

The rebase formula rewards veAERO holders most when locking rates decrease, incentivizing new participants to lock tokens. Note that veAERO supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers—only voting incentives.
