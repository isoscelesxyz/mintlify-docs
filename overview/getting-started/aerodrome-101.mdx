For anyone new to DeFi and Aerodrome, this brief explainer may help you understand how onchain systems work (and what “onchain” even means).

## DeFi 101

**Ethereum**

Ethereum is a popular blockchain. A blockchain is a digital ledger that is distributed across a network of computers rather than living on a centralized server.

Unlike Bitcoin, which functions as a currency, Ethereum is a platform where developers can build apps, ranging from financial services to social networks. ETH is the native currency of Ethereum, and it's used to pay "gas fees," the costs of running computations and storing data on the network.

**Smart contracts**

As a developer platform, Ethereum introduced a technology called "smart contracts." Smart contracts are pieces of code that operate autonomously and are immutable (cannot be altered). Smart contracts function like digital building blocks, enabling the creation of decentralized applications.

Long term, Ethereum may serve as infrastructure for a new vision of the internet powered by microtransactions, native currencies, and decentralized value distribution. This system would provide an alternative to today's digital economy, one driven largely by advertising and dominated by tech giants like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

**DeFi**

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement to give people around the globe easy access to financial instruments and services without the need for banks, brokers, or other intermediaries. DeFi isn't just a theory—millions of people use it today—but it's still evolving and comes with risks.

Traditional finance relies on banks, brokers, and market makers to maintain "liquidity" (fast and easy access to assets, facilitating global trading and commerce). The current system works but it also includes inefficiencies and many layers of middlemen, each extracting fees.

DeFi aims to deliver financial services with transparency, security, lower costs, and improved accessibility.

**Base and L2s**

As Ethereum rose in popularity, the network became slower and more expensive to operate on. As a solution to this, developers started creating "Layer 2s" (L2s). These networks are blockchains themselves, but they are faster and cheaper to use because they batch transactions and send them to Ethereum less often, thus reducing gas costs and wait times. Base is an L2 created by Coinbase. It is one of the fastest-growing and most successful L2s to date.

**The Importance of Liquidity**

For an economy or marketplace to function, people must be able to easily access currencies and assets. This is called liquidity, and it’s one of DeFi’s most critical challenges. In a traditional system, people can go to a bank or currency exchange and get dollars or euros or yen. But, in a decentralized system, how can users access and buy digital currencies?

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase are one way to solve the liquidity problem. These exchanges operate similarly to banks, holding large amounts of digital assets and enabling users to trade them for traditional currencies. However, CEXs are limited in what assets they support and remain centralized points of control.

**Decentralized liquidity**

Centralized exchanges require accounts, can freeze funds, and may exclude users based on geography or regulations. DEXs, by contrast, are censorship-resistant: anyone with a crypto wallet can trade, anywhere in the world, without permission. This open access is one of DeFi’s core promises—financial services available to anyone with an internet connection.

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) address these limitations directly. Unlike centralized platforms, DEXs use peer-to-peer networks to facilitate asset swaps without holding user assets centrally. Instead, DEXs rely on users depositing tokens into "liquidity pools," pairs of assets (such as BTC and ETH) whose ratios determine token prices. When users swap tokens, they're actually trading directly through these decentralized pools rather than centralized entities.

**A brief history of DEXs**

Early DEXs like EtherDelta (2017) and 0x protocol used manual order books, struggling with low liquidity and slow trades. The breakthrough came in 2018 when Uniswap popularized the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, allowing users to deposit paired tokens into liquidity pools and enabling automatic trades. Asset prices were determined algorithmically by the ratio of tokens in pools, dramatically improving liquidity and efficiency.

However, early AMMs quickly learned that liquidity providers (LPs)—the users depositing assets—were opportunistic, moving their tokens frequently between platforms chasing higher yields. This created instability and slippage (unexpected price changes during a trade) for users, challenging DEX reliability.

In response, modern DEXs recognized the necessity of not just innovative technology but also sophisticated economic systems to retain LPs.

**Problems with traditional DEX design:**

**Capped rewards:** Most DEXs incentivize LPs with a portion of swap fees, so if there is a slow trading week, LPs earn little rewards.

**Misaligned stakeholdership:** Most DEXs have to balance the needs and interests of many stakeholders. They have investors who want a return, a team that wants to get paid, LPs who want high rewards and, of course, token swappers who want reliable, low-fee trades. Many have also introduced another stakeholder group: tokenholders (people who hold the native token of the DEX). Historically, the challenge is one of misalignment: if they increase the value for one stakeholder, it's at the expense of another. The entire operation becomes a juggling act.

## Aerodrome 101

**The MetaDEX**

MetaDEXs (Velodrome and Aerodrome) solve the alignment problem with an innovative economic system that puts their native tokens at the center. See MetaDEX to learn more.

**Where we are today**

Today, DeFi powers billions in daily trading volume. From simple swaps to advanced financial products, decentralized systems are becoming as reliable and liquid as traditional finance, but far more open. MetaDEXs represent the latest stage of this evolution, where economic incentives are designed for long-term sustainability.

Aerodrome is the leading MetaDEX on Base. To get started, you’ll need a wallet, some tokens on Base, and an understanding of a few key concepts, covered in the glossary that follows.
