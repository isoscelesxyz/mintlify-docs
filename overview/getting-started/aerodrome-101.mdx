This page explains DeFi fundamentals and how Aerodrome's MetaDEX model solves traditional DEX problems. Read this to understand the context and innovation behind Aerodrome. This guide is for anyone new to DeFi and Aerodrome who wants to understand how <Tooltip tip="On blockchain - activity that happens on a blockchain network">onchain</Tooltip> systems work.

## DeFi 101

### Ethereum

Ethereum is a popular <Tooltip tip="A distributed digital ledger across a network of computers">blockchain</Tooltip>. Unlike Bitcoin, which functions as a currency, Ethereum is a platform where developers can build apps, ranging from financial services to social networks. ETH is the native currency of Ethereum, and it's used to pay <Tooltip tip="Transaction fees paid to network validators">gas fees</Tooltip>—the costs of running computations and storing data on the network.

### Smart contracts

As a developer platform, Ethereum introduced a technology called <Tooltip tip="Self-executing code that runs autonomously and cannot be altered">smart contracts</Tooltip>. Smart contracts function like digital building blocks, enabling the creation of decentralized applications.

<Info>
  Long term, Ethereum may serve as infrastructure for a new vision of the internet powered by microtransactions, native currencies, and decentralized value distribution. This system would provide an alternative to today's digital economy, one driven largely by advertising and dominated by tech giants like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement to give people around the globe easy access to financial instruments and services without the need for banks, brokers, or other intermediaries. DeFi isn't just a theory—millions of people use it today—but it's still evolving and comes with risks.

Traditional finance relies on banks, brokers, and market makers to maintain <Tooltip tip="Fast and easy access to assets for trading">liquidity</Tooltip>. The current system works but it also includes inefficiencies and many layers of middlemen, each extracting fees.

DeFi aims to deliver financial services with transparency, security, lower costs, and improved accessibility.

### Base and Layer 2s

As Ethereum rose in popularity, the network became slower and more expensive to operate on. As a solution to this, developers started creating <Tooltip tip="Blockchains that batch transactions and settle to Ethereum, reducing costs">Layer 2s (L2s)</Tooltip>. These networks are blockchains themselves, but they are faster and cheaper to use because they batch transactions and send them to Ethereum less often, thus reducing gas costs and wait times.

Base is an L2 created by Coinbase. It is one of the fastest-growing and most successful L2s to date.

### The liquidity challenge

For an economy or marketplace to function, people must be able to easily access currencies and assets. This is called liquidity, and it's one of DeFi's most critical challenges. In a traditional system, people can go to a bank or currency exchange and get dollars or euros or yen. But in a decentralized system, how can users access and buy digital currencies?

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase are one way to solve the liquidity problem. These exchanges operate similarly to banks, holding large amounts of digital assets and enabling users to swap them or exchange them for traditional currencies. However, CEXs are limited in what assets they support and they remain centralized points of control.

### How DEXs work

Centralized exchanges require accounts, can freeze funds, and may exclude users based on geography or regulations. DEXs, by contrast, are censorship-resistant: anyone with a crypto wallet can trade, anywhere in the world, without permission.

<Tip>
  This open access is one of DeFi's core promises—financial services available to anyone with an internet connection.
</Tip>

Unlike centralized platforms, DEXs use peer-to-peer networks to facilitate asset swaps, relying on users depositing tokens into "liquidity pools": pairs of assets (such as BTC and ETH) whose ratios determine token prices. When users swap tokens, they're actually trading directly through these decentralized pools rather than centralized entities.

### The evolution of DEXs

Early DEXs like EtherDelta (2017) and 0x protocol used manual order books, struggling with low liquidity and slow trades. The breakthrough came in 2018 when Uniswap popularized the <Tooltip tip="Automated Market Maker - algorithms that govern liquidity pools and pricing">AMM</Tooltip> model, allowing users to deposit paired tokens into liquidity pools and enabling automatic trades. Asset prices were determined algorithmically by the ratio of tokens in pools, dramatically improving liquidity and efficiency.

However, early AMMs quickly learned that liquidity providers (LPs)—the users depositing assets—were opportunistic, moving their tokens frequently between platforms chasing higher yields. This created instability and <Tooltip tip="Unexpected price changes during a trade">slippage</Tooltip> for users, challenging DEX reliability.

In response, modern DEXs recognized the necessity of not just innovative technology but also sophisticated economic systems to retain LPs.

### Problems with traditional DEX design

Traditional DEXs face fundamental alignment problems:

#### Capped rewards

Most DEXs incentivize LPs with a portion of swap fees, so if there is a slow trading week, LPs earn little rewards. This leads to LP flight and unstable liquidity.

#### Misaligned stakeholders

Most DEXs have to balance the needs and interests of three primary stakeholders:

- **Liquidity providers** who want high rewards
- **Traders** who want reliable, low-fee swap
- **Tokenholders** who want value capture

Historically, the challenge is one of misalignment: if they increase the value for one stakeholder, it's at the expense of another. And this is before factoring in other parties such as investors and contributors.

<Info>
  **Solving the DEX Trilemma**: Traditional DEXs create competing interests between traders (want low fees), LPs (want high fees), and tokenholders (want value accrual). Aerodrome's MetaDEX model unifies all stakeholders through veAERO voting and 100% fee distribution to voters.

### The MetaDEX flywheel

The MetaDEX model creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Token Operators (veAERO holders) vote">
    veAERO voters direct weekly `AERO` token emissions to liquidity pools and share 100% of protocol revenue from pools they vote for (ensuring rewards go to productive liquidity)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Emissions attract liquidity">
    Liquidity providers deposit and stake to earn `AERO` rewards (which are generally higher in value and more steadily streamed than LP rewards in legacy DEXs)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Liquidity enables efficient swaps">
    Deep liquidity means traders get better swaps with minimal slippage, increasing volume (which increases revenue)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revenue attracts votes" stepNumber={4}>
    100% of revenue goes to token operators (veAERO voters) in exchange for voting
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each step reinforces the next, creating durable liquidity and long-term sustainability. This is the key innovation that sets MetaDEXs apart from traditional DEX designs.

### Where we are today

Today, DeFi powers billions in daily trading volume. From simple swaps to advanced financial products, decentralized systems are becoming as reliable and liquid as traditional finance, but far more open. MetaDEXs represent the latest stage of this evolution, where economic incentives are designed for long-term sustainability rather than short-term extraction.

Aerodrome is the leading MetaDEX on Base. To get started, you'll need a wallet, some tokens on Base, and an understanding of a few key concepts.
