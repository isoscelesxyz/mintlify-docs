[Flight School](https://aerodrome.finance/flight-school) is an onboarding program run by the [Aerodrome Foundation](/overview/contributors/aerodrome-foundation) that distributes veAERO to new participants who lock `AERO` for the first time.

In this concept, you'll learn how Flight School works, how it benefits new users joining the protocol, and how the buyback mechanism supports the broader ecosystem.

## How Flight School works

Flight School operates through a dedicated Foundation-managed wallet that holds 50M `AERO` (10% of initial supply) locked as veAERO. This wallet participates in weekly voting to generate value that funds the program.

**The buyback-and-distribute cycle**:

1. **Voting**: The Flight School wallet votes each <Tooltip tip="7-day period from Thursday 00:00 UTC to Wednesday 23:59 UTC">epoch</Tooltip> on select pools
2. **Revenue collection**: Trading fees and <Tooltip tip="Incentives deposited by protocols to attract votes to their gauges">incentives</Tooltip> accrue to the wallet as voting rewards
3. **Market buyback**: 100% of collected rewards are used to buy `AERO` from the market
4. **Lock and distribute**: Purchased `AERO` is locked as veAERO and distributed to eligible new participants

This mechanism helps new users bootstrap their voting participation without requiring large initial capital.

## Benefits for participants

**For new users**:

- Receive bonus veAERO when locking `AERO` for the first time
- Lower barrier to entry for voting participation
- Immediate voting power to participate in gauge voting
- Join the protocol with a Foundation-sponsored boost

**For the protocol**:

- Expands the base of active voters
- Creates programmatic buy pressure for `AERO`
- Aligns new users with long-term protocol success
- Distributes voting power to engaged community members

**For existing veAERO holders**:

- Flight School buybacks reduce circulating `AERO` supply
- Growing voter base increases protocol engagement
- More voters means more competitive gauge voting

## Flight School vs other programs

Flight School serves a different purpose than other Aerodrome programs:

| Program               | Purpose                                    | Mechanism                                  | Who benefits                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Flight School**     | Onboard new voters                         | Distribute veAERO to new lockers           | New users locking `AERO`            |
| **Aero Ignition**     | Launch new tokens via fair price discovery | Curated community launches                 | Token projects + early participants |
| **Public Goods Fund** | Support strategically important pools      | Direct emissions to under-supported assets | Ecosystem infrastructure            |

Flight School specifically targets **new individual participants** rather than protocols or existing large holders.

## Integration with Aerodrome ecosystem

Flight School works alongside other Foundation initiatives to support protocol growth:

**Foundation ecosystem wallets**:

- **Flight School**: Onboards new voters (this program)
- **Public Goods**: Supports strategically important pools with emissions
- **DevCo**: Funds protocol development (managed separately)

All three wallets hold 100% of their `AERO` as <Tooltip tip="Tokens are locked at the maximum duration and automatically re-locked each epoch">auto-max locked</Tooltip> veAERO, ensuring permanent alignment with protocol success.

**Revenue flow**:

- Approximately 30% of protocol revenue flows through Foundation wallets
- 100% of Flight School profits buy `AERO` and distribute as veAERO
- 100% of Public Goods profits compound back into veAERO
- No value extraction—all revenue recirculates to participants
