## Zero to claiming your first rewards

Estimated time: 10-20 minutes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    1. Visit [aerodrome.finance](https://aerodrome.finance)
    2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right corner
    3. Select your wallet provider (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, etc.)
    4. Approve the connection request in your wallet
    5. Verify you're on **Base network** (chain ID: 8453)

    <Info>
    If you're on the wrong network, your wallet will prompt you to switch to Base. Click "Switch Network" to continue.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get tokens on Base">
    You'll need tokens to trade and provide liquidity.

    **Option 1: Bridge from Ethereum**
    - Use the official [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org)
    - Or use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) for integrated bridging
    - Bridge USDC or ETH to Base

    **Option 2: Buy directly on Base**
    - Use fiat on-ramp services
    - Purchase ETH or USDC directly on Base network

    <Tip>
    For this quickstart, get at least $20 worth of USDC and $20 worth of ETH on Base to cover trading and gas fees.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your first swap">
    Let's swap ETH for USDC:

    1. Go to the [Swap](https://aerodrome.finance/swap) page
    2. Select tokens: **ETH** → **USDC**
    3. Enter amount (e.g., 0.01 ETH)
    4. Review <Tooltip tip="Maximum price movement you'll accept before the transaction fails">slippage tolerance</Tooltip> (default 0.5% is usually fine)
    5. Click **"Swap"**
    6. Approve the transaction in your wallet
    7. Wait for confirmation (usually 5-10 seconds on Base)

    **Congratulations!** You've made your first swap on Aerodrome.

    <Info>
    The Aerodrome router automatically finds the best price across all available pools. You'll see the route displayed before confirming.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide liquidity to a V2 stable pool">
    Now let's add liquidity to earn fees and <Tooltip tip="Weekly AERO token rewards distributed to liquidity pools based on veAERO votes">emissions</Tooltip>. We'll use a V2 stable pool (the simplest option for beginners):

    1. Go to the [Pools](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) page
    2. Search for **"USDC/USDbC"** (a stable pool)
    3. Click **"Add Liquidity"**
    4. Enter amount for one token (the pool auto-balances the other)
    5. Click **"Approve USDC"** (first time only)
    6. Click **"Approve USDbC"** (first time only)
    7. Click **"Add Liquidity"** and confirm transaction
    8. Receive LP tokens representing your pool position

    <Tip>
    V2 stable pools are full-range, meaning your liquidity is always active regardless of price movements. This makes them ideal for beginners.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Stake in a gauge to earn AERO">
    Staking your LP tokens allows you to earn `AERO` emissions:

    1. On the same pool page, find the **"Stake"** section
    2. Enter your LP token amount (or click **"Max"**)
    3. Click **"Stake"** and confirm transaction
    4. Your position is now earning `AERO` emissions!

    <Info>
    Emissions are distributed based on weekly veAERO votes. Pools with more votes receive more AERO. You can check the current vote allocation and estimated APR on the pool page.
    </Info>

    **What happens when you stake:**
    - ✅ Earn `AERO` emissions proportional to the pool's votes
    - ❌ Forfeit trading fees (they go to veAERO voters instead)
    - ✅ Can unstake at any time with no penalty

  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim your first rewards">
    Rewards accrue continuously and can be claimed anytime:

    1. Go to your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard)
    2. See your claimable `AERO` emissions in the rewards section
    3. Click **"Claim All"**
    4. Confirm the transaction
    5. `AERO` tokens are sent to your wallet!

    <Tip>
    Consider locking your earned AERO to create veAERO. This gives you voting power to earn protocol fees and direct emissions to your favorite pools.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed: 'Insufficient allowance'" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Cause**: You haven't approved the token for spending by Aerodrome contracts.

    **Solution**:
    1. Click the **"Approve [TOKEN]"** button
    2. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet
    3. Wait for approval confirmation
    4. Retry your swap or liquidity action

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't see my LP tokens in wallet" icon="eye-slash">
    **Cause**: LP tokens may not auto-display in wallet token lists.

    **Solution**:
    - Go to the [Pools page](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) to see all your positions
    - Alternatively, manually add the LP token contract address to your wallet
    - Your positions are safe even if not visible in wallet

    <Info>
    The Aerodrome UI always shows your complete position list, regardless of wallet display.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High slippage warning when swapping" icon="percent">
    **Cause**: Low liquidity in the pool or very large trade size relative to available liquidity.

    **Solution**:
    - **Reduce trade amount** - Try swapping a smaller amount
    - **Increase slippage tolerance** (carefully - higher slippage = potentially worse execution)
    - **Wait for better liquidity** - More liquidity may be added to the pool
    - **Check the route** - Ensure the swap is routing through liquid pools

    <Tip>
    For large trades, consider splitting into multiple smaller transactions to reduce price impact.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Swap failed: 'Transaction deadline exceeded'" icon="clock">
    **Cause**: The transaction took too long to process and exceeded the deadline (default 30 minutes).

    **Solution**:
    - **Retry the swap** - Market conditions may have changed
    - **Increase deadline** - Go to swap settings and extend the deadline
    - **Check network congestion** - Base is usually fast, but occasionally busy

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a specific token" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Cause**: Token may not be in the default token list.

    **Solution**:
    1. Click the token selector dropdown
    2. Paste the token's **contract address** directly into the search box
    3. The token will appear if it exists on Base
    4. Verify the contract address matches official sources

    <Warning>
    Always verify token contract addresses from official project sources. Scam tokens with similar names exist.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong network / Can't connect to Base" icon="link-slash">
    **Cause**: Your wallet is connected to a different network (Ethereum, Arbitrum, etc.).

    **Solution**:
    1. Look for a network switcher in your wallet
    2. Select **"Base"** from the network list
    3. If Base isn't listed, add it manually:
       - Network Name: Base
       - RPC URL: https://mainnet.base.org
       - Chain ID: 8453
       - Currency Symbol: ETH
       - Block Explorer: https://basescan.org

## Understanding your position

### Position types on Aerodrome

**You now have:**

- **LP tokens** - Represent your liquidity in the USDC/USDbC pool
- **Staked position** - Your LP tokens are staked in the gauge
- **Claimable rewards** - `AERO` emissions accumulating from gauge

### How rewards work

**Emissions (what you're earning now):**

- Distributed based on veAERO votes for your pool
- Accrue continuously throughout the week (epoch)
- Claimable at any time
- No lock period on claimed `AERO`

**Trading fees (what voters earn):**

- When you staked your LP tokens, you forwarded fee rights to veAERO voters
- Voters receive 100% of swap fees from the pool
- This incentivizes voters to vote for your pool (more votes = more emissions for you)

### What to do with earned AERO

#### Option 1: Sell for stablecoins

- Swap your `AERO` for USDC or other tokens
- Realize profits immediately

#### Option 2: Lock for veAERO (recommended)

- [Lock AERO](/overview/core-features/lock) for up to 4 years
- Earn voting rewards (fees + incentives from pools you vote for)
- Earn rebases (additional `AERO` distributed to veAERO holders)
- Participate in governance

#### Option 3: Provide more liquidity

- Use earned `AERO` to create new LP positions
- Compound your returns by increasing liquidity
