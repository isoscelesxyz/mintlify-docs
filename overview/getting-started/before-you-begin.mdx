description: "Essential information about DeFi risks, wallet security, and protocol considerations before using Aerodrome Finance"
---

Before you start using Aerodrome Finance, understand the foundational risks and requirements common to all decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

## What you'll need

**Wallet with Base network support:**

You need a Web3 wallet configured for the Base network. Popular options include:

- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [Rabby](https://rabby.io/)
- [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)

**ETH on Base for gas fees:**

All transactions on Base require ETH to pay for gas fees. Bridge ETH to Base using the [official Base bridge](https://bridge.base.org) or a third-party bridge.

**Tokens to interact with the protocol:**

To swap, provide liquidity, or participate in governance, you'll need the relevant tokens in your wallet on Base.

## Understanding DeFi risks

Using Aerodrome involves inherent risks common to all DeFi protocols. You should understand these risks before interacting with the protocol.

**Smart contract risk**

Aerodrome runs on smart contracts deployed to Base. While these contracts are audited and battle-tested, smart contracts can contain vulnerabilities that may result in loss of funds.

What this means for you:
- **Contracts** may have undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities
- **Protocol upgrades** could introduce new risks
- **Interactions with other protocols** increase complexity and risk

Mitigations:
- Review [Aerodrome's security audits](/security) from leading security firms
- The protocol has processed billions in volume with no major exploits
- Start with small amounts until you're comfortable

**Impermanent loss**

When you provide liquidity to a pool, you deposit two tokens. If the price ratio between those tokens changes, you may have less value than if you had simply held the tokens.

Learn more: [What is Impermanent Loss?](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-glossary/what-is-impermanent-loss) (Coinbase Learn)

What this means for you:
- **Price volatility** between paired tokens creates impermanent loss
- **Loss timing**: The loss is "impermanent" because it only realizes when you withdraw
- **Fee offset**: Trading fees can offset impermanent loss, but there's no guarantee

Mitigations:
- Provide liquidity to pairs with correlated prices (e.g., stablecoin pairs)
- Understand the volatility profile of your chosen tokens
- Monitor your position and withdraw if impermanent loss exceeds acceptable levels

**Governance and protocol risks**

Aerodrome is governed by veAERO holders who vote on emissions distribution and protocol changes. Governance decisions can impact the value of your positions.

What this means for you:
- **Emissions shifts**: Emissions can shift between pools based on governance votes
- **Parameter changes**: Protocol parameters may change through governance
- **Incentive volatility**: Your liquidity pool's incentives can increase or decrease based on votes

Mitigations:
- Participate in governance by locking AERO for veAERO
- Monitor governance proposals that may affect your positions
- Diversify across multiple pools to reduce concentration risk

**Liquidity risk**

Some pools may have low liquidity, making it difficult to enter or exit positions without significant price impact.

What this means for you:
- **High slippage**: Low liquidity pools may have high slippage on swaps
- **Market impact**: Withdrawing large positions can move the market against you
- **Low fees**: Some pools may have minimal trading volume, reducing fee generation

Mitigations:
- Check pool liquidity (TVL) before providing liquidity
- Start with high-liquidity pools like WETH/USDC or major stablecoin pairs
- Use limit orders or split large trades across time

**Counterparty and bridge risk**

To use Aerodrome on Base, you typically bridge assets from Ethereum or other chains. Bridges introduce additional risks.

What this means for you:
- **Bridge exploits**: Bridges can be exploited or fail, resulting in loss of bridged assets
- **Bridge security**: Bridged tokens depend on the bridge operator's security
- **Peg risk**: Wrapped or bridged versions of tokens may depeg from their underlying asset

Mitigations:
- Use official bridges like the [Base bridge](https://bridge.base.org)
- Verify token addresses before trading (see [verified tokens](/reference/tokens))
- Bridge only what you plan to use in the near term

## Wallet security best practices

Your wallet is your responsibility. Follow these best practices to secure your funds:

**Use a hardware wallet for large amounts:** Hardware wallets like [NGRAVE](https://ngrave.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) store your private keys offline, protecting against malware and phishing attacks.

**Never share your seed phrase:** Your seed phrase (recovery phrase) gives complete control of your wallet. No legitimate service will ever ask for it.

**Verify contract addresses:** Before approving token allowances, verify you're interacting with official Aerodrome contracts. See [contract addresses](/reference/contracts).

**Revoke unused token approvals:** Use tools like [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) to revoke token approvals you no longer need. This limits damage if a contract is exploited.

**Beware of phishing:** Always verify you're on the official Aerodrome domain before connecting your wallet. Bookmark the official site and use that bookmark.

## No financial guarantees

Aerodrome Finance is a decentralized protocol. Using the protocol does not guarantee:

- **Yields**: Specific yields or returns
- **Loss protection**: Protection from impermanent loss
- **Capital preservation**: Preservation of capital
- **Profit**: Earnings that exceed transaction costs

**Past performance does not indicate future results.** Pool APRs fluctuate based on trading volume, emissions, and governance votes.

## Regulatory considerations

DeFi protocols operate in an evolving regulatory landscape. You are responsible for understanding the legal and tax implications of using Aerodrome in your jurisdiction.

**Consult with qualified professionals** about:

- **Taxes**: Tax obligations on trading gains, liquidity provision, and governance rewards
- **Regulations**: Regulatory restrictions on DeFi participation in your country
- **Reporting**: Reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions

Aerodrome Finance does not provide legal, tax, or financial advice.
