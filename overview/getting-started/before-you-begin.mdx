This page explains the risks and prerequisites for using Aerodrome. Read this before engaging with the protocol to understand what you'll need and the inherent risks common to all <Tooltip tip="Decentralized Finance - financial services without intermediaries like banks">DeFi</Tooltip> protocols.

## What you'll need

### Wallet with Base network support

You need a Web3 wallet configured for the Base network. Popular options include:

- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [Rabby](https://rabby.io/)
- [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)

### ETH on Base for gas fees

All transactions on Base require ETH to pay for <Tooltip tip="Transaction fees paid to network validators">gas fees</Tooltip>. Bridge ETH to Base using the [official Base bridge](https://bridge.base.org) or a third-party bridge.

### Tokens to interact with the protocol

To swap, provide liquidity, or participate in governance, you'll need the relevant tokens in your wallet on Base.

## Understanding DeFi risks

Using Aerodrome involves inherent risks common to all DeFi protocols. You should understand these risks before interacting with the protocol.

### Smart contract risk

Aerodrome runs on smart contracts deployed to Base. While these contracts are audited and battle-tested, smart contracts can contain vulnerabilities that may result in loss of funds.

#### What this means for you

- **Contracts** may have undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities
- **Protocol upgrades** could introduce new risks
- **Interactions with other protocols** increase complexity and risk

#### Mitigations

- Review [Aerodrome's security audits](/overview/security/overview) from leading security firms
- The protocol has processed billions in volume with no major exploits
- Start with small amounts until you're comfortable

### Impermanent loss

When you provide liquidity to a pool, you deposit two tokens. If the price ratio between those tokens changes, you may have less value than if you had simply held the tokens.

Learn more: [What is Impermanent Loss?](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-glossary/what-is-impermanent-loss) (external resource)

#### What this means for you

- **Price volatility** between paired tokens creates impermanent loss
- **Loss timing**: The loss is "impermanent" because it only realizes when you withdraw
- **Fee offset**: Trading fees can offset impermanent loss, but there's no guarantee

#### Mitigations

- Provide liquidity to pairs with correlated prices (e.g., stablecoin pairs)
- Understand the volatility profile of your chosen tokens
- Monitor your position and withdraw if impermanent loss exceeds acceptable levels

### Governance and protocol risks

Aerodrome is governed by veAERO holders who vote on emissions distribution and protocol changes. Governance decisions can impact the value of your positions.

#### What this means for you

- **Emissions shifts**: Emissions can shift between pools based on governance votes
- **Parameter changes**: Protocol parameters may change through governance
- **Incentive volatility**: Your liquidity pool's incentives can increase or decrease based on votes

#### Mitigations

- Participate in governance by locking `AERO` for veAERO
- Monitor governance proposals that may affect your positions
- Diversify across multiple pools to reduce concentration risk

### Liquidity risk

Some pools may have low liquidity, making it difficult to enter or exit positions without significant price impact.

#### What this means for you

- **High slippage**: Low liquidity pools may have high slippage on swaps
- **Market impact**: Withdrawing large positions can move the market against you
- **Low fees**: Some pools may have minimal trading volume, reducing fee generation

#### Mitigations

- Check pool liquidity (TVL) before providing liquidity
- Start with high-liquidity pools like WETH/USDC or major stablecoin pairs
- Use limit orders or split large trades across time

### Counterparty and bridge risk

To use Aerodrome on Base, you typically bridge assets from Ethereum or other chains. Bridges introduce additional risks.

#### What this means for you

- **Bridge exploits**: Bridges can be exploited or fail, resulting in loss of bridged assets
- **Bridge security**: Bridged tokens depend on the bridge operator's security
- **Peg risk**: Wrapped or bridged versions of tokens may depeg from their underlying asset

#### Mitigations

- Use official bridges like the [Base bridge](https://bridge.base.org)
- Verify token addresses before trading (see [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/overview#contract-addresses))
- Bridge only what you plan to use in the near term

## Wallet security best practices

Your wallet is your responsibility. Follow these best practices to secure your funds:

### Use a hardware wallet for large amounts

Hardware wallets like [NGRAVE](https://ngrave.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) store your private keys offline, protecting against malware and phishing attacks.

### Never share your seed phrase

Your seed phrase (recovery phrase) gives complete control of your wallet. No legitimate service will ever ask for it.

### Verify contract addresses

Before approving token allowances, verify you're interacting with official Aerodrome contracts. See [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/overview#contract-addresses).

### Revoke unused token approvals

Use tools like [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) to revoke token approvals you no longer need. This limits damage if a contract is exploited.

### Beware of phishing

Always verify you're on the official Aerodrome domain before connecting your wallet. Bookmark the official site and use that bookmark.

## No financial guarantees

<Warning>
Aerodrome Finance is a decentralized protocol. Using the protocol does not guarantee:

- **Yields**: Specific yields or returns
- **Loss protection**: Protection from impermanent loss
- **Capital preservation**: Preservation of capital
- **Profit**: Earnings that exceed transaction costs

**Past performance does not indicate future results.** Pool APRs fluctuate based on trading volume, emissions, and governance votes.

</Warning>

## Regulatory considerations

DeFi protocols operate in an evolving regulatory landscape. You are responsible for understanding the legal and tax implications of using Aerodrome in your jurisdiction.

**Consult with qualified professionals** about:

- **Taxes**: Tax obligations on trading gains, liquidity provision, and governance rewards
- **Regulations**: Regulatory restrictions on DeFi participation in your country
- **Reporting**: Reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions

Aerodrome Finance does not provide legal, tax, or financial advice.

## Your responsibility

<Warning>
By using Aerodrome Finance, you acknowledge:

- You understand the risks outlined on this page
- You are responsible for your own research and decisions
- You accept full responsibility for any losses incurred
- You will not hold the Aerodrome team, contributors, or community liable for losses

If you're uncertain about any of these risks, consult with qualified professionals before proceeding.

</Warning>
