This reference defines essential terms and concepts for understanding Aerodrome and decentralized finance. Use this as a comprehensive glossary when encountering unfamiliar terminology throughout the documentation.

## General DeFi Terms

**Blockchain**: As a public ledger, a blockchain is an alternative form of digital infrastructure that functions similarly to a server. But instead of living on one computer, it's distributed across a large network.

**Tokens**: The technology at the heart of crypto. All cryptocurrencies are tokens. All NFTs are tokens. Bitcoin is a token. ETH is a token. Anything that can be traded, bought, swapped, deposited, etc. is a token. Many tokens are "fungible," meaning they're interchangeable (e.g. one bitcoin is the same as any other bitcoin). Other tokens are "non-fungible" which means they're unique (e.g. a piece of NFT art). Stablecoins are tokens that are correlated one way or another with another asset (e.g. USDC is backed one-to-one with the U.S. dollar).

**Protocol**: In crypto, a protocol is another word for an app.

**Wallet**: A digital tool (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or hardware wallets) that allows users to hold, send, and interact with crypto. Many decentralized protocols do not offer traditional "accounts." Instead, users simply connect their wallet. For this reason, users don't have to share personal information like email addresses and names with the protocols they use.

**Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: A website/application where users can trade one token for another. As opposed to "centralized exchanges," DEXs are not institutions or businesses that hold the tokens users swap for. Instead, tokens are deposited by other users known as "liquidity providers."

**Liquidity**: The amount of an asset or token that is available for users to "buy" or trade for. Liquidity is an essential need of any functioning economy, onchain or off.

**Onchain**: Similar to "online" but for describing activity that happens on a blockchain.

## Liquidity & Trading

**Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: Users who deposit their own assets (crypto/tokens) into a DEX, thus enabling token swaps for users. LPs are rewarded for this service, either with a share of swap fees or more tokens (on Aerodrome, `AERO`).

**Liquidity Pools**: The underlying technology of DEXs are "liquidity pools": pairs of assets/tokens that are made available to swap for each other. Liquidity pools are powered by smart contracts—self-executing pieces of code—and governed by algorithms (automated market makers).

**Staked Liquidity**: Liquidity deposited into Aerodrome pools and "staked" to earn `AERO` emissions.

**Unstaked Liquidity**: Liquidity deposited but not staked. Earns swap fees.

**Impermanent Loss**: A potential risk for LPs: when the value of tokens in a liquidity pool shifts compared to just holding them. See also: [Liquidity Pools](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/index).

**Slippage**: The difference between the price quoted before the swap and the actual executed price due to market movements or liquidity depth.

**Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**: These are the algorithms that govern liquidity pools and how tokens are priced within them. There are two types of AMMs used by Aerodrome: Basic and Concentrated. Both basic and concentrated pools can then be "stable" or "volatile," depending on the relationship between the two assets in the pool. Tokens with closely correlated value (e.g. different "versions" of the same token) are considered "stable." Assets that are uncorrelated (e.g. a memecoin paired with BTC) are considered "volatile."

**Basic Pools**: Liquidity pools that maintain token prices through simple, reliable algorithms—the constant-product curve and stable swap curve—ensuring tokens can always be easily traded. Ideal for general-purpose liquidity, these pools require minimal management from liquidity providers. Aerodrome supports both UniV2-style and Curve-style basic pools.

**Concentrated Pools (Slipstream)**: Concentrated liquidity pools that require LPs to select the price range where their liquidity is active. Inspired by UniV3, Slipstream introduces key enhancements, such as decoupling tick spacing from fees, wider tick spaces, and native reward streaming limited only to active liquidity.

**Price Impact**: The price change caused by your trade size relative to the pool's liquidity depth. Larger trades in smaller pools create more price impact. Different from slippage—price impact is predictable based on trade size, while slippage occurs from market movements or other transactions.

## Concentrated Liquidity (Advanced)

**Tick**: Discrete price levels in concentrated liquidity pools where liquidity can be placed. Slipstream pools divide the entire price curve into these individual ticks, allowing precise liquidity positioning.

**Tick Spacing**: The minimum interval between usable ticks in a pool, determining how granular your price ranges can be. Lower tick spacing (1, 10) allows tighter ranges but requires more active management. Higher tick spacing (200, 2000) requires wider minimum ranges with less frequent rebalancing.

**Active Range**: The specific price range where your concentrated liquidity position is currently earning fees and emissions. When the market price moves outside this range, your position stops earning until price returns or you rebalance.

**Dynamic Fees**: Slipstream's automatic fee adjustment mechanism that increases fees during high volatility to compensate LPs for increased risk and price impact. Fees scale based on recent trading volatility and pool conditions.

**Unstaked Fee Rake**: In concentrated liquidity pools, 10% of fees from unstaked positions are directed to veAERO voters, while 90% goes to the LP. This incentivizes voters to support CL pools even when liquidity isn't staked for emissions.

**LVR (Loss-Versus-Rebalancing)**: The theoretical cost of providing liquidity compared to holding and rebalancing a static portfolio. Concentrated liquidity pools minimize LVR through dynamic fees and efficient capital deployment within active ranges.

## Aerodrome-Specific Terms

**MetaDEX**: A next-generation DEX model that distributes 100% of protocol revenue to active voters who direct token emissions. This creates sustainable alignment between traders, liquidity providers, and tokenholders. See [What is Aerodrome?](/overview/index) for a full explanation.

**`AERO`**: The native protocol token of Aerodrome, used for governance and rewards. Users can lock `AERO` to receive veAERO and participate in voting.

**veAERO**: Vote-escrowed `AERO` - locked `AERO` tokens that grant governance rights and voting power. The longer the lock period (1 week to 4 years), the more voting power granted. veAERO holders vote to direct emissions and earn protocol revenue.

**Epochs**: Aerodrome operates on seven-day epochs, starting every Thursday at 00:00 UTC and ending the following Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. Emissions, fee distributions, voting, governance actions, and all other protocol activities align with this weekly schedule.

**Emissions**: New `AERO` tokens that are automatically minted each week and distributed to liquidity providers based on gauge votes. Emissions follow a decay schedule detailed in [Emissions](/overview/tokenomics/emissions).

**Gauges**: Gauges act as clearing houses for activity related to specific pools, aggregating swap fees, votes, and incentives for weekly distribution. Only pools with active gauges are eligible to receive emissions.

**Incentives (Bribes)**: Tokens deposited into gauges (often by protocols) to incentivize voters to direct emissions to specific pools. Incentives are distributed to veAERO voters who vote for that pool.

**Protocol Revenue**: Any value that is internalized by the protocol or claimable by tokenholders. There are currently three sources of revenue: 100% of swap fees from staked liquidity, 10% of swap fees from unstaked liquidity in emissions-eligible Slipstream pools, and 100% of incentive deposits. All protocol revenue goes to veAERO voters.

**Rebase**: Each week, veAERO holders receive additional veAERO tokens proportional to their voting power, reducing dilution from new emissions. For example, if you hold 100 veAERO, you might receive 2-3 additional veAERO weekly depending on the rebase rate.

**Locking**: In Aerodrome, "locking" refers to the process of converting liquid `AERO` into an NFT that grants its holder governance rights (namely, the ability to vote to direct weekly token emissions). Locked tokens do not disappear or decay, but they are made non-transferable until the lock period ends. The longer the lock period, the more voting power is granted.

**Relay**: Aerodrome's automation tool for managing veAERO positions, including voting, reward claims, and position adjustments. Relays simplify governance participation for veAERO holders.

## Advanced veNFT Concepts

**veNFT**: The ERC-721 NFT token representing locked `AERO`. Each veNFT is transferable, can be merged or split, and grants voting rights proportional to the amount locked and lock duration remaining.

**Managed veNFT (mveNFT)**: A special veNFT controlled by a Relay strategy that aggregates voting power from multiple deposited positions. Users deposit their veNFTs into an mveNFT to enable automated voting and reward management.

**Permanent Lock (Auto-Max Lock)**: A veNFT setting that automatically maintains maximum lock duration (4 years) indefinitely. The lock never decays and voting power remains constant. This setting is irreversible—once enabled, the veNFT can only be transferred or sold, never unlocked.

**Voting Power**: The weight of your veAERO when voting on weekly gauge emissions. Calculated as locked `AERO` amount multiplied by remaining lock duration. Used to direct `AERO` emissions to liquidity pools.

**Governance Power**: The weight of your veAERO when voting on protocol proposals (via Snapshot or onchain governance). Same numeric value as voting power but used for protocol-level decisions rather than weekly emissions.

**Merge**: Combining multiple veNFTs into a single position. All `AERO` from merged veNFTs consolidates into one NFT with a weighted-average lock duration. This operation is irreversible—merged veNFTs are permanently burned.

**Split**: Dividing one veNFT into multiple smaller positions. All resulting veNFTs inherit the original lock expiry date. Useful for selling portions of a position or diversifying voting strategies.

**Delegation**: Lending your veNFT's voting power to another address while retaining ownership and rebases. The delegatee controls gauge votes but you keep governance power and earn rebases. Delegation can be revoked at any time.

## Protocol Programs & Tools

**Aero Ignition**: Aerodrome's curated community fair-launch program for new tokens. Features structured price discovery, anti-MEV protections, and Foundation support. See [Aero Ignition](/overview/partners/aero-ignition) for details.

**Flight School**: Foundation program that distributes veAERO to new participants who lock `AERO` for the first time. Funded through a dedicated wallet that uses 100% of voting rewards to buy `AERO` from the market and lock it for distribution. See [Flight School](/overview/partners/flight-school).

**Slipstream**: Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity implementation with enhancements over Uniswap V3, including decoupled tick spacing, dynamic fees, and optimized reward streaming. Named to distinguish from basic V2-style pools.

**Sugar**: Aerodrome's onchain API for querying protocol data without external dependencies. Provides read-only access to pool information, positions, rewards, and voting data directly from blockchain state. See [Sugar API](/development/sugar).

**AERO Fed**: Governance system activated when emissions drop below 9M per epoch. Allows veAERO voters to collectively decide each week whether to increase (0.01% of supply), decrease (0.01% of supply), or maintain emission rates. This creates community-controlled monetary policy.

**Launcher**: Permissionless pool creation system that allows any project to launch liquidity pools with optional liquidity locking. Projects can create V2 or concentrated pools, set initial pricing, and lock liquidity to signal long-term commitment. See [Launcher](/overview/partners/launcher).

**Autopilot**: Automated liquidity management for concentrated pools provided by Mellow. Automatically rebalances CL positions to keep them in range based on market conditions and historical performance. Mellow collects 10% of rewards earned for providing this service. See [Autopilot](/overview/core-features/lock/autopilot).
