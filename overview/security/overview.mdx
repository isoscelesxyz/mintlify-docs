## Emergency Council, Foundations and Public Goods Fund

To support the health of the protocol and ecosystem, there is a Council consisting of members from the Aerodrome team and prominent figures from within the Optimism and Base community.

The Council can be spawned in case of emergency situations or by passing a governance proposal that requires the council's help to be executed.

The Council address is at `0x99249b10593fCa1Ae9DAE6D4819F1A6dae5C013D` and it:

- can set a new `emergencyCouncil`
- can kill a gauge
- can revive a gauge
- can set a custom name or symbol for a pool
- can activate or deactivate (m)veNFTs (superseded by the governance once enabled)

Important multisigs:
