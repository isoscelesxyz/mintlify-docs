<Warning>This page is a draft. The information here may be inaccurate or incomplete.</Warning>

You can interact with Aerodrome contracts directly through Basescan when the frontend is unavailable or you prefer direct contract interaction.

## Before you begin

- Web3 wallet connected to Base network
- ETH for gas fees
- Familiarity with [token approvals](/help/faqs/users#how-do-approvals-work-and-when-are-they-needed)

### Key contract addresses

| Contract     | Address                                                                                                                 | Use for          |

## Approve tokens

Before swapping, depositing liquidity, or locking AERO, you must approve the relevant contract to spend your tokens.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the token contract on Basescan">
    Navigate to the token you want to approve (e.g., [AERO](https://basescan.org/address/0x940181a94A35A4569E4529A3CDfB74e38FD98631#writeContract)).
  </Step>

<Step title="Connect your wallet">
  Click **Write Contract** → **Connect to Web3** and connect your wallet.
</Step>

<Step title="Call the approve function">
  Find the `approve` function and enter: - **spender**: The contract address you're approving
  (Router, VotingEscrow, etc.) - **amount**: The amount in wei, or use
  `115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935` for unlimited
  approval
</Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the transaction">
    Click **Write** and confirm in your wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Swap tokens

<Steps>
  <Step title="Approve the Router">
    Approve the Router (`0xcF77a3Ba9A5CA399B7c97c74d54e5b1Beb874E43`) to spend your input token.
  </Step>

<Step title="Navigate to the Router contract">
  Go to [Router on
  Basescan](https://basescan.org/address/0xcF77a3Ba9A5CA399B7c97c74d54e5b1Beb874E43#writeContract) →
  **Write Contract** → **Connect to Web3**.
</Step>

  <Step title="Call swapExactTokensForTokens">
    Find `swapExactTokensForTokens` and enter:

    | Parameter | Description | Example |
    |-----------|-------------|---------|
    | `amountIn` | Amount to swap (in wei) | `1000000000000000000` (1 token with 18 decimals) |
    | `amountOutMin` | Minimum output (slippage protection) | Set to ~98% of expected output |
    | `routes` | Swap path as tuple array | See below |
    | `to` | Your wallet address | `0xYourAddress` |
    | `deadline` | Unix timestamp | Current time + 1200 (20 minutes) |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the transaction">
    Click **Write** and confirm in your wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Routes parameter format

The `routes` parameter is an array of tuples. For a direct swap:

```
[["0xInputToken", "0xOutputToken", false, "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"]]
```

| Field     | Description                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`    | Input token address                                               |
| `to`      | Output token address                                              |
| `stable`  | `true` for stable pools (correlated assets), `false` for volatile |
| `factory` | Use zero address (`0x0000...`) for default                        |

<Tip>
  Use `stable: true` for correlated pairs like USDC/USDT. Use `stable: false` for uncorrelated pairs
  like WETH/AERO.
</Tip>

## Lock AERO for veAERO

Create a veAERO lock using the VotingEscrow contract.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Approve VotingEscrow">
    Approve VotingEscrow (`0xeBf418Fe2512e7E6bd9b87a8F0f294aCDC67e6B4`) to spend your AERO.
  </Step>

<Step title="Navigate to VotingEscrow">
  Go to [VotingEscrow on
  Basescan](https://basescan.org/address/0xeBf418Fe2512e7E6bd9b87a8F0f294aCDC67e6B4#writeContract) →
  **Write Contract** → **Connect to Web3**.
</Step>

  <Step title="Call createLock">
    Find `createLock` and enter:

    | Parameter | Description | Example |
    |-----------|-------------|---------|
    | `_value` | AERO amount in wei (18 decimals) | `1000000000000000000000` (1000 AERO) |
    | `_lockDuration` | Lock duration in seconds | `126144000` (4 years max) |

    Common lock durations:
    - 1 year: `31536000`
    - 2 years: `63072000`
    - 4 years: `126144000`

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the transaction">
    Click **Write** and confirm in your wallet. You'll receive a veNFT representing your lock.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  You cannot withdraw AERO before your lock expires. Voting power decays linearly over time—longer
  locks provide more voting power.
</Warning>

## Vote on gauges

Vote with your veAERO to direct emissions to pools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your veNFT token ID">
    Your token ID was assigned when you created your lock. Find it in your wallet's NFT section or on [Basescan](https://basescan.org) by checking your transaction history.
  </Step>

<Step title="Get pool addresses">
  Find the pool addresses you want to vote for. You can find these on the [Aerodrome
  app](https://aerodrome.finance/vote) or by querying the PoolFactory contract.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Voter">
  Go to [Voter on
  Basescan](https://basescan.org/address/0x16613524e02ad97eDfeF371bC883F2F5d6C480A5#writeContract) →

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>

## Finding pool addresses

To vote or add liquidity, you need pool addresses. Here's how to find them:

**Option 1: Use the Aerodrome frontend**

Browse pools at [aerodrome.finance/pools](https://aerodrome.finance/pools) and copy the pool address.

**Option 2: Query PoolFactory on Basescan**

1. Go to [PoolFactory](https://basescan.org/address/0x420DD381b31aEf6683db6B902084cB0FFECe40Da#readContract)
2. Use `getPool(tokenA, tokenB, stable)` to find a pool address
3. Enter both token addresses and `true`/`false` for stable/volatile

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction reverted">
    Common causes:
    - Token not approved for the contract
    - Incorrect parameter format (especially for arrays)
    - Deadline timestamp is in the past
    - Insufficient balance or gas
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient allowance error">
  You need to approve the contract to spend your tokens. See [Approve tokens](#approve-tokens)
  above.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="EXPIRED error on swap">
  Your deadline timestamp has passed. Use a timestamp in the future (current Unix time + 1200
  seconds).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Array length mismatch on vote">
  The `_poolVote` and `_weights` arrays must have the same number of elements, and weights must sum
  to exactly 10000.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find my veNFT token ID">
    Check your wallet's NFT section, or search your address on Basescan and look for the `createLock` transaction. The token ID is in the transaction logs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
