This guide helps you resolve common issues when using Aerodrome. If your problem isn't covered here, reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/aerodrome).

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Rabby) connected to Base
- Sufficient ETH on Base for gas fees
- Latest version of your browser

## Swapping Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction fails with 'Insufficient liquidity'" icon="droplet">
    **Cause:** The pool doesn't have enough liquidity to support your swap size at the current slippage tolerance.

    **Solution:**
    - Reduce your swap amount
    - Increase slippage tolerance (be cautious of price impact)
    - Try splitting the swap into smaller transactions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High slippage warning appears" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Cause:** Large trades relative to pool liquidity cause significant price impact.

    **Solution:**
    - Reduce swap amount
    - Check if you're using the correct token address
    - Consider using a different route if available
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Approve' transaction required before swap" icon="check-circle">
    **This is normal behavior.** Before swapping a token for the first time, you must approve the Aerodrome router contract to spend that token.

    After approval completes, submit your swap transaction.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidity Provision Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't find my token when adding liquidity" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Solution:**
    - Verify the token contract address from an official source
    - Paste the contract address directly into the token search field
    - Ensure you're connected to Base network
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction fails when staking LP tokens" icon="layer-group">
    **Causes:**
    - Wallet/RPC connection issue
    - Pool is not listed (only listed pools can be staked)

    **Solutions:**
    - Hard refresh the app (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
    - Try a different RPC endpoint in your wallet settings
    - Verify the pool is listed on Aerodrome
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not receiving emissions after staking" icon="coins">
    **Possible reasons:**
    - Pool received zero votes this epoch
    - Your CL position is out of range
    - Emissions haven't been distributed yet (check epoch timing)

    **Check:**
    - View the pool's vote weight on the Vote page
    - For CL pools, verify your position is within the active price range
    - Emissions distribute at the start of each Thursday epoch
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Voting and Locking Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't vote - no veAERO balance showing" icon="lock">
    **Cause:** You need to lock `AERO` to receive veAERO before voting.

    **Solution:**
    See [How to Lock AERO](/guides/vote/lock-aero) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Votes not updating immediately" icon="clock">
    **This is normal.** Vote changes may take a few seconds to reflect on-chain.

    Refresh the page after 10-15 seconds to see updated vote allocation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't claim voting rewards" icon="gift">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Rewards haven't been distributed yet (Thursday 00:00 UTC)
    - You didn't vote in the previous epoch
    - No fees/incentives were generated for pools you voted for

    **Solution:**
    - Wait until Thursday after epoch flip
    - Verify you voted before Wednesday 23:59 UTC deadline
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Wallet and Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wallet won't connect" icon="wallet">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify you're on Base network in your wallet
    - Clear browser cache and cookies
    - Try a different wallet or browser
    - Disable browser extensions that might interfere
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transactions stuck as pending" icon="spinner">
    **Solutions:**
    - Check Base block explorer (basescan.org) for transaction status
    - If stuck for >5 minutes, try increasing gas price and resubmitting
    - Clear pending transactions in your wallet if needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
