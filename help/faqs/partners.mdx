## Pool Creation and Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a pool?" icon="plus">
    Pool creation on Aerodrome is permissionless. Simply go to the [Liquidity page](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) and click New Deposit to get started.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What type of pool should I launch (V2, V3)?" icon="flask">
    **Basic Volatile Pools (V2-style):**

    These pools distribute liquidity evenly across the entire price range from 0 to infinity, similar to traditional AMMs like Uniswap V2. They are simple to manage and can often be treated as "set and forget" for both you and your users. They are particularly well-suited for early price discovery, making them a strong option for new or emerging tokens.

    **Concentrated Pools (V3-style):**

    These pools allow liquidity providers to concentrate their capital within specific price ranges rather than across the entire curve, similar to Uniswap V3. They are designed for tokens that have an active market-making operation to keep liquidity within a defined price range. They provide greater capital efficiency but require more active management compared to basic pools.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which connector token should I choose?" icon="link">
  The most common connector tokens are `WETH`, `USDC`, and `cbBTC`. `AERO` can also be used as a
  connector token. As a rule of thumb, token pairs that are more correlated will lead to less
  impermanent loss and thus lead to more TVL growth.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much liquidity should my pool have?" icon="droplet">
    We recommend depositing liquidity equal to at least 1-2% of your token's <Tooltip tip="Fully Diluted Valuation - total supply multiplied by token price">FDV</Tooltip>.

    If your team is experienced with managing concentrated ranges or working with a market maker, a concentrated pool may be more appropriate. In that case, providing a minimum of \$200,000 to \$300,000 in `USDC`, `WETH`, or `cbBTC` liquidity will be generally sufficient to support most swaps — however we still recommend closer to 1-2% of FDV if you intend to support larger swaps.

    <Tip>
    For concentrated pools, consider using automated liquidity management tools like Autopilot (from Mellow) to maintain your position within the active range.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I split my liquidity across multiple DEXs or concentrate it on Aerodrome?" icon="split">
    We strongly recommend projects concentrate all their liquidity on Aerodrome rather than splitting between multiple DEXs. Fragmenting liquidity across different platforms negatively impacts price execution for traders swapping directly on Aerodrome's frontend, resulting in worse trading experiences.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Listing Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is listing on Aerodrome?" icon="list-check">
    Listing is Aerodrome's approval process that allows pools to participate in the protocol's incentive system. Pools that are not listed operate as fee-based pools and do not have access to Aerodrome's rewards mechanism. In essence, listing is the step that elevates a pool from a standard fee-based participant to a fully integrated member of Aerodrome's incentivized ecosystem.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the benefits of listing my pool?" icon="star">
    **Listing enables:**

    - **Staking rewards**: LPs can stake positions and earn `AERO` emissions
    - **Incentive deposits**: Project teams can deposit incentives to attract liquidity
    - **Reward multiplier**: Historically, voter rewards translate to approximately 1.5x-2x in `AERO` rewards for staked LPs
    - **Ecosystem support**: Marketing support and guidance on working within AERO

    <Info>
    The historical 1.5x-2x multiplier is based on past performance and is not guaranteed. Actual returns depend on voting patterns, emissions, and market conditions.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the requirements for listing?" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Minimum volume threshold:**

    - **DEX trading**: \$1 million daily average over 30 days
    - **CEX trading**: \$2 million daily average over 30 days

    **Additional evaluation factors:**

    In addition to trading volume, we evaluate product-market fit, tokenomics, distribution, security, and overall traction. In rare cases, tokens that do not fully meet these requirements may be fast-tracked for listing, but such exceptions are uncommon.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I start the listing process?" icon="paper-plane">
  You can begin the listing process by engaging directly with the Aerodrome team.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What marketing support does Aerodrome provide?" icon="bullhorn">
    **Pre-listed tokens:**

    - Social engagement through likes and comments

    **Listed tokens:**

    - Likes, comments, retweets, and quote tweets where relevant
    - X Spaces participation (subject to availability)
    - Additional ad-hoc communication opportunities (case-by-case basis)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Incentives and Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I incentivize liquidity before my pool is listed?" icon="circle-question">
    Projects can use third-party platforms like Merkl or Metrom to incentivize Aerodrome liquidity prior to listing.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="If listed, how much should I deposit in incentives?" icon="coins">
  Listed projects can deposit incentives up to the lower of 15x the value of fees generated by the
  pool and 5% of the value of Connector Tokens (e.g. `USDC`, `WETH`) in the pool. Newly listed
  tokens are granted a 4-week grace period to establish liquidity before fee-based limits apply.
  During this time projects may use 5% of their TVL in Connector Tokens as the incentive benchmark.
  We would recommend using the full 5% during the grace period.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why should I stake my LP?" icon="layer-group">
  When you stake your liquidity, you choose to earn `AERO` emissions instead of trading fees.
  Unstaked LPs earn 90% of trading fees directly, with 10% going to `veAERO` voters. However, when
  you stake your LP tokens, 100% of the fees generated by your staked liquidity are redistributed as
  incentives to `veAERO` voters, which then translates into `AERO` emissions for your staked
  position. Historically, every dollar of fees generated by staked liquidity, combined with
  team-deposited incentives, has translated into roughly 1.5x in `AERO` rewards for liquidity
  providers.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm trying to stake but the transaction fails" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    This is likely a wallet related issue, we suggest hard refreshing the app and/or using a different RPC.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration and Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I get my token logo on Aerodrome's UI?" icon="image">
    Aerodrome uses SmolDapp's decentralised hosting for token logos. To have your token logo displayed, submit a PR to the [SmolDapp tokenAssets repository](https://github.com/SmolDapp/tokenAssets) with your token's logo.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I migrate my LP from another network?" icon="bridge">
  LP tokens cannot be bridged directly. Instead, you will need to bridge your token to Base. To do
  this, you can create a bridged version of your token on Base through any interoperability provider
  such as Hyperlane, Chainlink, LayerZero, or Wormhole. You may also use the Base native bridge,
  which is the simplest option, but we only recommend it if you intend to migrate all token activity
  to Base. The reason is that withdrawals back to Mainnet involve a 7-day delay, which can create a
  poor user experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How should I migrate my LP from another DEX?" icon="truck">
  You can migrate your liquidity in a single transaction, or you can spread it out across multiple
  withdrawals.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My token is not being priced on the frontend" icon="dollar-sign">
  For tokens to be priced on the frontend by default they need to be paired with a connector token
  like `WETH`, `USDC`, `cbBTC` or `AERO`; \$500 liquidity should be enough.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you have a method for snapshotting LPs on Aerodrome?" icon="camera">
  You can use this [Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/3407081) to snapshot LPs for a given pool.
  This query allows you to see all liquidity providers and their positions at a specific point in
  time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the default pool fees?" icon="percent">
  | Pool Type | Fee | |-----------|-----| | Basic Volatile | 0.3% | | Basic Stable | 0.05% | |
  Concentrated Stable 1 | 0.01% | | Concentrated Stable 10 | 0.05% | | Concentrated Stable 50 |
  0.05% | | Concentrated Volatile 100 | 0.05% | | Concentrated Volatile 200 | 0.3% | | Concentrated
  Volatile 2000 | 1% |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I update pool fees?" icon="pen-to-square">
  To update the fees for your pool, you will need to submit a request directly to the Aerodrome
  team, who will process the change.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the APR formula?" icon="calculator">
    For basic pools (vAMM/sAMM):

<Latex>
  APR = secondsPerYear * emissions * emissionsTokenPriceUsd / ((staked0 * staked0PriceUsd) +
  (staked1 * staked1PriceUsd))
</Latex>

    For concentrated liquidity (CL) pools:

<Latex>
  APR = secondsPerYear * emissions * emissionsTokenPriceUsd / (staked1 * staked1PriceUsd)
</Latex>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the benefits of locking liquidity?" icon="lock">
    Locking LP tokens signals long-term commitment to your project and the ecosystem:

    **For your project:**
    - Demonstrates credibility and reduces rug pull concerns
    - Shows confidence in long-term token viability
    - May improve listing prospects and community trust
    - Locked liquidity is publicly visible

    **Lock features:**
    - Owner receives 100% of rewards from locked position by default
    - Optional beneficiary can be set with custom percentage split
    - Lock ownership is transferable
    - Duration configurable (1 month to 1+ year)

    **Technical details:**
    - Create pool, add liquidity, and lock can be done in one transaction
    - Supports programmatic integration for launchpads
    - See [Pool Launcher Specification](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/pool-launcher/blob/develop/SPECIFICATION_POOL_LAUNCHER.md) for contract details

## Aero Ignition

<Info>
  For complete details on Aero Ignition including the full 4-week timeline, key benefits, emissions
  caps, and launch checklists, see the [Aero Ignition
  documentation](/overview/partners/aero-ignition).
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Aero Ignition?" icon="rocket">
    Aero Ignition is Aerodrome's curated fair-launch framework for community-aligned token launches. Projects deposit unpriced incentives (up to 4% of supply) before trading begins, allowing veAERO voters to price the token through an auction-like mechanism. After 1 week, trading opens with organic liquidity formation and price discovery.

    **Key features:**
    - Fair distribution with anti-sniping protections
    - Immediate Coinbase DEX integration listing
    - Deep liquidity from AERO emissions
    - Transparent onchain price discovery
    - Curated launches (one at a time for maximum exposure)

    **Timeline**: 4-week process from incentive deposit → trading opens → fees sustain liquidity. See [Aero Ignition documentation](/overview/partners/aero-ignition) for the complete timeline and requirements.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the implied FDV so low during Week 1?" icon="chart-line">
    Implied FDV increases throughout the week as more veAERO voters allocate votes to the pool. Most voting activity happens in the final 24 hours of each epoch as voters wait to see total vote allocation before committing.

    **How it works:**
    - Projects deposit unpriced incentives (e.g., 4% of supply)
    - Voters bid for share of incentives by allocating votes
    - More votes → higher estimated incentive value → higher implied FDV

    **Formula**: `Implied FDV = (Estimated Incentive Value) / (% of supply deposited)`

    This gradual price discovery is intentional—it prevents manipulation and allows the market to organically determine fair value. By Wednesday evening (vote deadline), you'll see the final implied FDV based on total vote weight.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I apply for an Aero Ignition launch?" icon="paper-plane">
    Aero Ignition launches are highly curated and selective. Only one launch happens at a time to maximize exposure and reduce noise.

    **Application process:**
    1. Review the [project checklist](/overview/partners/aero-ignition#project-checklist) to ensure you meet requirements
    2. Prepare project documentation: tokenomics, use case, community size, security audits
    3. Reach out to the Aerodrome team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/aerodrome)
    4. Be ready to discuss launch timing, incentive amounts, and coordination

    **What Aerodrome looks for:**
    - Strong product-market fit and real utility
    - Engaged community and social presence
    - Transparent tokenomics and fair distribution
    - Alignment with Base ecosystem growth
    - Commitment to long-term liquidity provision

    The team will work with selected projects to coordinate the launch timeline and ensure successful execution.
