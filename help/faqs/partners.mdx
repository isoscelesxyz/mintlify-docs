## Pool Creation and Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a pool?" icon="plus">
    Pool creation on Aerodrome is permissionless. Simply go to the [Liquidity page](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) and click New Deposit to get started.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What type of pool should I launch (V2, V3)?" icon="flask">
    **Basic Volatile Pools (V2-style):**

    These pools distribute liquidity evenly across the entire price range from 0 to infinity, similar to traditional AMMs like Uniswap V2. They are simple to manage and can often be treated as "set and forget" for both you and your users. They are particularly well-suited for early price discovery, making them a strong option for new or emerging tokens.

    **Concentrated Pools (V3-style):**

    These pools allow liquidity providers to concentrate their capital within specific price ranges rather than across the entire curve, similar to Uniswap V3. They are designed for tokens that have an active market-making operation to keep liquidity within a defined price range. They provide greater capital efficiency but require more active management compared to basic pools.

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Which connector token should I choose?" icon="link">
  The most common connector tokens are `WETH`, `USDC`, and `cbBTC`. `AERO` can
  also be used as a connector token. As a rule of thumb, token pairs that are
  more correlated will lead to less impermanent loss and thus lead to more TVL
  growth.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much liquidity should my pool have?" icon="droplet">
    We recommend depositing liquidity equal to at least 1-2% of your token's FDV.

    If your team is experienced with managing concentrated ranges or working with a market maker, a concentrated pool may be more appropriate. In that case, providing a minimum of \$200,000 to \$300,000 in `USDC`, `WETH`, or `cbBTC` liquidity will be generally sufficient to support most swaps — however we still recommend closer to 1-2% of FDV if you intend to support larger swaps.

    <Tip>
    For concentrated pools, consider using automated liquidity management tools like Autopilot (from Mellow) to maintain your position within the active range.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I split my liquidity across multiple DEXs or concentrate it on Aerodrome?" icon="split">
    We strongly recommend projects concentrate all their liquidity on Aerodrome rather than splitting between multiple DEXs. Fragmenting liquidity across different platforms negatively impacts price execution for traders swapping directly on Aerodrome's frontend, resulting in worse trading experiences.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Listing Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is listing on Aerodrome?" icon="list-check">
    Listing is Aerodrome's approval process that allows pools to participate in the protocol's incentive system. Pools that are not listed operate as fee-based pools and do not have access to Aerodrome's rewards mechanism. In essence, listing is the step that elevates a pool from a standard fee-based participant to a fully integrated member of Aerodrome's incentivized ecosystem.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the benefits of listing my pool?" icon="star">
    **Listing enables:**

    - **Staking rewards**: LPs can stake positions and earn `AERO` emissions
    - **Incentive deposits**: Project teams can deposit incentives to attract liquidity
    - **Reward multiplier**: Historically, voter rewards translate to approximately 1.5x-2x in `AERO` rewards for staked LPs
    - **Ecosystem support**: Marketing support and guidance on working within AERO

    <Info>
    The historical 1.5x-2x multiplier is based on past performance and is not guaranteed. Actual returns depend on voting patterns, emissions, and market conditions.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the requirements for listing?" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Minimum volume threshold:**

    - **DEX trading**: \$1 million daily average over 30 days
    - **CEX trading**: \$2 million daily average over 30 days

    **Additional evaluation factors:**

    In addition to trading volume, we evaluate product-market fit, tokenomics, distribution, security, and overall traction. In rare cases, tokens that do not fully meet these requirements may be fast-tracked for listing, but such exceptions are uncommon.

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do I start the listing process?" icon="paper-plane">
  You can begin the listing process by engaging directly with the Aerodrome
  team.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What marketing support does Aerodrome provide?" icon="bullhorn">
    **Pre-listed tokens:**

    - Social engagement through likes and comments

    **Listed tokens:**

    - Likes, comments, retweets, and quote tweets where relevant
    - X Spaces participation (subject to availability)
    - Additional ad-hoc communication opportunities (case-by-case basis)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Incentives and Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I incentivize liquidity before my pool is listed?" icon="circle-question">
    Projects can use third-party platforms like Merkl or Metrom to incentivize Aerodrome liquidity prior to listing.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion
  title="If listed, how much should I deposit in incentives?"
  icon="coins"
>
  Listed projects can deposit incentives up to the lower of 15x the value of
  fees generated by the pool and 5% of the value of Connector Tokens (e.g.
  `USDC`, `WETH`) in the pool. Newly listed tokens are granted a 4-week grace
  period to establish liquidity before fee-based limits apply. During this time
  projects may use 5% of their TVL in Connector Tokens as the incentive
  benchmark. We would recommend using the full 5% during the grace period.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Why should I stake my LP?" icon="layer-group">
  When you stake your liquidity, you choose to earn `AERO` emissions instead of
  trading fees. Unstaked LPs earn 90% of trading fees directly, with 10% going
  to `veAERO` voters. However, when you stake your LP tokens, 100% of the fees
  generated by your staked liquidity are redistributed as incentives to `veAERO`
  voters, which then translates into `AERO` emissions for your staked position.
  Historically, every dollar of fees generated by staked liquidity, combined
  with team-deposited incentives, has translated into roughly 1.5x in `AERO`
  rewards for liquidity providers.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm trying to stake but the transaction fails" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    This is likely a wallet related issue, we suggest hard refreshing the app and/or using a different RPC.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration and Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I get my token logo on Aerodrome's UI?" icon="image">
    Aerodrome uses SmolDapp's decentralised hosting for token logos. To have your token logo displayed, submit a PR to the [SmolDapp tokenAssets repository](https://github.com/SmolDapp/tokenAssets) with your token's logo.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How can I migrate my LP from another network?" icon="bridge">
  LP tokens cannot be bridged directly. Instead, you will need to bridge your
  token to Base. To do this, you can create a bridged version of your token on
  Base through any interoperability provider such as Hyperlane, Chainlink,
  LayerZero, or Wormhole. You may also use the Base native bridge, which is the
  simplest option, but we only recommend it if you intend to migrate all token
  activity to Base. The reason is that withdrawals back to Mainnet involve a
  7-day delay, which can create a poor user experience.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How should I migrate my LP from another DEX?" icon="truck">
  You can migrate your liquidity in a single transaction, or you can spread it
  out across multiple withdrawals.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion
  title="My token is not being priced on the frontend"
  icon="dollar-sign"
>
  For tokens to be priced on the frontend by default they need to be paired with
  a connector token like `WETH`, `USDC`, `cbBTC` or `AERO`; \$500 liquidity
  should be enough.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion
  title="Do you have a method for snapshotting LPs on Aerodrome?"
  icon="camera"
>
  You can use this [Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/3407081) to snapshot
  LPs for a given pool. This query allows you to see all liquidity providers and
  their positions at a specific point in time.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What are the default pool fees?" icon="percent">
  | Pool Type | Fee | |-----------|-----| | Basic Volatile | 0.3% | | Basic
  Stable | 0.05% | | Concentrated Stable 1 | 0.01% | | Concentrated Stable 10 |
  0.05% | | Concentrated Stable 50 | 0.05% | | Concentrated Volatile 100 | 0.05%
  | | Concentrated Volatile 200 | 0.3% | | Concentrated Volatile 2000 | 1% |
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How can I update pool fees?" icon="pen-to-square">
  To update the fees for your pool, you will need to submit a request directly
  to the Aerodrome team, who will process the change.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the APR formula?" icon="calculator">
    For basic pools (vAMM/sAMM):

<Latex>
  APR = secondsPerYear * emissions * emissionsTokenPriceUsd / ((staked0 *
  staked0PriceUsd) + (staked1 * staked1PriceUsd))
</Latex>

    For concentrated liquidity (CL) pools:

<Latex>
  APR = secondsPerYear * emissions * emissionsTokenPriceUsd / (staked1 *
  staked1PriceUsd)
</Latex>

## Aero Launch

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Aero Launch?" icon="rocket">
    Aerodrome Launch is a tool that streamlines creating and deploying pools for token creators and launchpads. Included with the tool is a free liquidity locker that anyone can use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the benefits of using Aero Launch?" icon="check">
    Aero Launch streamlines pool creation and management for token creators and launchpads:

    - **Simplified deployment**: User-friendly interface removes the need for complex smart contract interactions
    - **Integrated liquidity locker**: Demonstrate long-term commitment to your project's liquidity
    - **Ecosystem optimization**: Pools created via Aero Launch are automatically configured for Aerodrome's incentive mechanisms and future listing eligibility
    - **Support and features**: Access to team support for fee optimization and exposure through features like the "emerging" tag

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can you tell me more about the LP locking?" icon="lock">
  You will be able to lock positions and become the owner of that lock, by
  default receiving 100% of the rewards from the locked position. Additionally a
  beneficiary can be set with a percentage. Ownership of that lock can be
  transferred as well.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can you only add 1 address as a beneficiary?" icon="user">
  Yes, only 1 beneficiary address.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can the Aero Launch functions be automated?" icon="robot">
  Yes, create pool, add liquidity, lock liquidity, set beneficiary and/or
  transfer ownership can be done in one transaction by your contracts.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you have any integration docs for Aero Launch?" icon="book">
    Technical documentation and specifications are available in the pool-launcher repository:

    - [Pool Launcher Specification](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/pool-launcher/blob/develop/SPECIFICATION_POOL_LAUNCHER.md) - Contract interface for creating pools

</AccordionGroup>

## Aero Ignition

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the timing of everything for Community Launches?" icon="clock">
    **Week 1**

    1-5% of supply deposited as incentives with no price. Voters vote for their share of these tokens. The value of the emissions voted that way gives an approximate initial value like an auction.

    **Week 2**

    Trading opens, emissions flow to the pool, liquidity grows organically, price discovery happens, traders pay fees which will be deposited to attract votes and emissions in week 3. Projects then deposit one more week of incentives but by this time those incentives are market priced like any other so can be a much smaller % of total supply.

    **Week 3**

    Fees from week 1 can now carry it from here assuming they're sustaining enough (have the benefit of the 1.3-1.5x multiplier) or the project can add more incentives.

    On net, a much better deal than 10% out the door day 1 — or than if teams were seeding and incentivizing directly. Giving projects way more of their own token to react to whatever the market throws at them later on.

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What are the gauge caps for Aero Ignition?" icon="gauge-high">
  Aero Ignition pools are limited to 15% of total weekly emissions. If `veAERO`
  votes push emissions beyond this threshold, the excess is redirected
  proportionally to other pools according to vote weight.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the implied FDV formula?" icon="square-root-variable">
    Simple formula:
    ```
    FDV = (% of votes on pool * total epoch rewards) / % total supply of incentive
    ```

    Extended formula:
    ```
    FDV = (% votes on Pool * $ Total Emissions² * (1 - % Votes on Pool)) / (% Total Epoch Rewards * % Total Supply of Incentive)
    ```

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Why is the implied FDV so low?" icon="chart-line">
  As voters continue to grow for the Community Launch pool, the FDV will
  increase. Most voting happens in the last 24 hours of every epoch.
