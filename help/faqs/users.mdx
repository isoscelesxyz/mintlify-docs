## Tokens and Governance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is AERO and what role does it play in governance?" icon="coins">
    `AERO` is the utility token of Aerodrome. It is distributed each week through a process called "emissions" in which voters direct newly minted tokens to liquidity providers with staked deposits. Learn more about [emissions and tokenomics](/overview/tokenomics/emissions).
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What is veAERO, and how do I lock tokens?" icon="lock">
  `veAERO` is the governance token of Aerodrome. It is created by locking `AERO`
  for up to four years. Holders of `veAERO` vote each week to distribute `AERO`
  to LPs. In exchange for this service, voters receive 100% of protocol revenue
  from the pools they vote for. See [How to Lock AERO](/guides/vote/lock-aero)
  for step-by-step instructions.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What is a gauge?" icon="gauge">
  A gauge functions like the clearing house for each liquidity pool that is
  eligible for emissions. `veAERO` holders cast votes which go into the gauge,
  new `AERO` emissions are sent to the gauge for distribution, and fees and
  incentives are also in the gauge before being sent to voters for that pool.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do incentives work, and why do protocols use them?" icon="gift">
    Incentives are tokens deposited into liquidity pool gauges with the aim of attracting voters to direct emissions to the pool. They are integral to the bootstrapping mechanics of Aerodrome. For example: if a protocol wants liquidity providers to deposit tokens in a new pool before it has any swap fees, they can deposit an incentive. That incentive attracts voters (who claim the incentive if they vote for the pool). The more votes for the pool, the more `AERO` emissions are directed to it. Then liquidity providers deposit and stake liquidity in the pool to earn those emissions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidity and Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are trading fees distributed between LPs and veNFT holders?" icon="chart-pie">
    **Fee distribution summary:**

    - **Staked liquidity**: 100% of trading fees sent to voters
    - **Unstaked concentrated liquidity**: 10% of fees sent to voters; 90% to LPs
    - **Unstaked basic liquidity**: 100% of fees sent to LPs

    <Warning>
    If you stake your liquidity, you will only receive emissions and forfeit all trading fees.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I claim my rewards?" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    ### To claim your rewards

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard) on Aerodrome
  </Step>
  <Step>Find your deposit and expand the details</Step>
  <Step>Click "Claim" to collect your rewards</Step>
</Steps>
### Reward types

    - **Staked positions**: Receive `AERO` emissions
    - **Unstaked positions**: Receive trading fees in the pool's token pair

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What does it mean to 'stake' my LP?" icon="layer-group">
  Staking your deposit means you will no longer receive swap fees as rewards and
  instead will receive `AERO` emissions. This is beneficial when the `AERO`
  emissions directed to the pool (based on votes) exceed the trading fees you
  would earn from unstaked liquidity.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion
  title="Why am I not receiving emissions from my LP?"
  icon="circle-question"
>
  Only deposits that have been staked are eligible for emissions. If your
  deposit is staked and you still do not receive emissions, it could be because
  the pool received no votes or your CL position fell out of the active price
  range.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can I not redeem trading fees from my LP?" icon="circle-question">
    If you have an unstaked deposit, you will earn a portion of swap fees. To claim, go to your dashboard, expand the deposit list, and select "Claim".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pool Types and Trading

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between volatile and stable pools?" icon="water">
    Volatile pools are optimized for non-correlated assets (e.g. `AERO` and `BTC`). Stable pools are optimized for closely correlated assets (often different versions of the same asset, e.g. `WETH` and `ETH`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does CLAMM work?" icon="chart-line">
    Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity solution is called "Slipstream." LPs who deposit into a concentrated pool must select a price range where their liquidity will be active. They will then receive rewards only when the actively traded price is within that range. They can also choose to use "Autopilot," an automated liquidity management tool from Mellow.

    <Warning>
    CL pools require active management to stay in range. If your position falls outside the active price range, you will not earn rewards until the price returns to your range.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Concentrated Liquidity (CL)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are ticks and tick spacing in CL pools?" icon="ruler">
    Concentrated liquidity pools divide the price curve into discrete "ticks." Tick spacing determines the granularity of ranges you can set. Lower tick spacing (1, 10) allows tighter ranges but requires more active management. Higher tick spacing (50, 100, 200) provides wider minimum ranges with less frequent rebalancing needs.

    Different fee tiers have different tick spacings:
    - Stable 1 (0.01% fee): tick spacing 1
    - Stable 10 (0.05% fee): tick spacing 10
    - Volatile 100 (0.05% fee): tick spacing 100
    - Volatile 200 (0.3% fee): tick spacing 200
    - Volatile 2000 (1% fee): tick spacing 2000

    <Tip>
    Lower tick spacing = tighter ranges = more active management required
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I choose a narrow vs wide range for my CL position?" icon="arrows-left-right">
    **Narrow ranges (1-5% price range):**
    - Higher capital efficiency = more fees per dollar
    - Requires active monitoring and frequent rebalancing
    - Best for: Stable pairs (USDC/DAI), experienced LPs, high-volume pools

    **Wide ranges (10-50% price range):**
    - Lower capital efficiency but less management
    - Stays in range longer during volatility
    - Best for: Volatile pairs (AERO/WETH), passive LPs, lower-volume pools

    **Consider:**
    - Historical price volatility of the pair
    - Your time commitment for rebalancing
    - Fee tier of the pool (higher fees = wider ranges acceptable)

    <Tip>
    Check the pool's 7-day price range on the Aerodrome app to inform your range selection.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when price moves out of my CL range?" icon="circle-exclamation">
    When the active price exits your selected range:

    1. **You stop earning fees** - No swap activity occurs within your range
    2. **No emissions if staked** - Staked CL positions only earn when in range
    3. **Your position converts to 100% of one token** - Acts as a limit order
    4. **You need to rebalance** - Either adjust your range or accept zero rewards

    **To rebalance:**
    - Remove liquidity from the current position
    - Select a new range around current price
    - Re-add liquidity (requires approvals and gas)

    **Alternatives:**
    - Use multiple positions with laddered ranges
    - Use [Autopilot](/overview/core-features/autopilot) for automated rebalancing

    <Warning>
    Out-of-range positions earn zero rewards. Monitor your positions regularly or use Autopilot for automatic management.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I rebalance a CL position?" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Manual rebalancing requires removing and re-adding liquidity:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Remove current position">
        Go to your CL position and click "Remove Liquidity." You'll receive both tokens based on the current price.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select new range">
        Create a new position with an updated price range centered around the current market price.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add liquidity">
        Deposit both tokens into the new range. Approve tokens if first time.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Stake for emissions">
        If the pool has a gauge, stake your new position to earn AERO emissions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Gas costs**: Each rebalance requires multiple transactions (remove, approve, add, stake).

    **Autopilot alternative**: [Autopilot](/overview/core-features/autopilot) handles rebalancing automatically for a 10% fee on earnings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add or remove liquidity from an existing CL position?" icon="plus-minus">
    **Adding liquidity to existing position:**
    - CL positions are NFTs representing specific ranges
    - You **cannot** add to an existing NFT position
    - Instead, create a new position with the same range parameters
    - You'll have multiple NFTs for the same range

    **Removing liquidity:**
    1. Navigate to your position in the Aerodrome app
    2. Click "Remove Liquidity"
    3. Choose amount to remove (partial or full)
    4. Confirm transaction
    5. Receive both tokens based on current price and your range

    **Partial removal**: You can remove a percentage of your position while keeping the rest active.

    <Info>
    Unlike V2 pools where you can add to existing positions, CL positions are individual NFTs that cannot be merged.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I claim CL fees and when should I stake the position?" icon="coins">
    **Claiming fees:**
    CL position fees accumulate automatically. To claim:
    1. Go to your Dashboard
    2. Find your CL position
    3. Click "Claim Fees"
    4. Receive fees in both pool tokens

    **When to stake your CL position:**

    **Stake when:**
    - Pool receives significant veAERO votes (check gauge voting)
    - AERO emissions APR > swap fee APR
    - You want exposure to AERO token

    **Don't stake when:**
    - Pool has low or zero votes
    - Swap fees > potential emissions
    - You prefer stable fee income over AERO
    - Your position is out of range (staking would earn nothing)

    <Tip>
    Compare "Unstaked APR" vs "Staked APR" on the pool page before deciding whether to stake.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are unstaked fees and why might I not stake my CL position?" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    When you provide CL liquidity **without staking**:
    - You earn **90% of swap fees** directly to your position
    - **10% of fees** go to veAERO voters (unstaked fee rake)
    - You earn **zero AERO emissions**

    **When NOT to stake:**

    ✅ **High fee generation** - Pool has high swap volume relative to emissions

    ✅ **Low votes** - Pool receives few veAERO votes (low AERO emissions)

    ✅ **Stable income preference** - You prefer predictable fee income over AERO token exposure

    ✅ **Out of range** - Your position is outside the active range (staking earns nothing anyway)

    ✅ **Short-term position** - You plan to exit soon and don't want AERO exposure

    The 10% unstaked fee rake goes to veAERO voters, incentivizing them to vote for your pool even if you're not staked.

    <Info>
    Check the pool's "Unstaked APR" on Aerodrome to see if fees alone provide good returns.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are ALM vaults and how do they work?" icon="vault">
    ALM (Automated Liquidity Management) vaults, also called [Autopilot](/overview/core-features/autopilot), are automated position managers for concentrated liquidity.

    **How they work:**
    1. You deposit tokens into a vault (instead of managing your own CL position)
    2. The vault automatically creates and manages CL positions
    3. Rebalancing happens automatically when price moves near range edges
    4. Multiple users share gas costs through batched operations
    5. You receive vault tokens (ERC-20) representing your share

    **Benefits:**
    - Automatic rebalancing (no manual management)
    - Lower gas costs (batched with other users)
    - Optimized ranges based on market conditions
    - Simple deposit/withdraw experience

    **Costs:**
    - 10% fee on all earnings (fees + emissions)
    - Smart contract risk (vault + Aerodrome contracts)

    **Powered by:** Mellow Finance provides the Autopilot automation

    <Tip>
    ALM vaults are ideal for users who want CL exposure without the complexity of manual range management.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What fee tiers are available for CL pools and how should I choose?" icon="percent">
    Slipstream CL pools offer multiple fee tiers optimized for different asset correlations:

    **Available fee tiers:**

    | Fee Tier | Tick Spacing | Best For | Example Pairs |
    |----------|--------------|----------|---------------|
    | 0.01% (1bps) | 1 | Highly correlated assets | USDC/DAI, wstETH/WETH |
    | 0.05% (5bps) | 10 | Stable/pegged assets | USDC/USDT, LST pairs |
    | 0.05% (5bps) | 100 | Correlated volatiles | WETH/wstETH |
    | 0.3% (30bps) | 200 | Standard volatile pairs | AERO/WETH, USDC/WETH |
    | 1% (100bps) | 2000 | Highly volatile/exotic | New tokens, low-liquidity pairs |

    **How to choose:**
    - **Lower fees** (0.01-0.05%): Stable pairs with high expected volume
    - **Medium fees** (0.3%): Standard volatile pairs (most common)
    - **Higher fees** (1%): Compensate for high volatility and wider spreads

    **Dynamic fees:** Slipstream pools can adjust fees automatically based on volatility, optimizing for market conditions.

    <Tip>
    Check existing pool TVL and volume. If a fee tier already has significant liquidity, it's likely the right choice.
    </Tip>

## Security and Protocol

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are Aerodrome contracts audited? By whom?" icon="shield-check">
    Chain Security is our preferred security partner. We usually involve their team as early as possible in the conversations about architecture security, trust assumptions and more generic security operations.

    We've also worked and have a deep appreciation for teams like Spearbit and Sherlock.

    To learn about our audits, please refer to our dedicated [security page](https://aerodrome.finance/security).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is team compensation structured?" icon="wallet">
    The launch of Aerodrome included the creation of a wallet dedicated to funding ongoing development and operations support. That wallet received 19% of the initial supply of `AERO` (as locked `veAERO`) and also receives 5% of weekly emissions. The wallet uses this voting position each week to earn rewards. Those rewards are then used to compensate the development company. This method of compensation is crucial to maintaining a sustainable system because it aligns the interests of any contributor with the interests of all other stakeholders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## veNFT Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I transfer veNFT?" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    veNFTs are transferable like any other NFT. Simply send from your wallet to the address of your choice.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I sell my veNFT?" icon="tag">
    veNFTs can easily be traded on third-party platforms, often at a discount.

    <Tip>
    veNFTs can be traded on third-party NFT marketplaces, often at a discount reflecting the lock duration.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I sell my veNFT?" icon="user-group">
    The recipient of the veNFT inherits all rights and control over the voting position.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Coinbase's DEX integration tie into Aerodrome?" icon="building-columns">
    Coinbase integrated DEX trading in August 2024. This means that Coinbase users can trade for assets on Aerodrome directly from the Coinbase UI. For Coinbase users, this means increased access to onchain assets. For liquidity providers, this means a new volume source. For protocols this means broader access to users. For `veAERO` holders, this means increased fees distributed as voting rewards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is 'the MetaDEX'?" icon="diagram-project">
    MetaDEX is the underlying model of Aerodrome. Think of it as an operating system for DEXs. The current version of the MetaDEX is METADEX02.
