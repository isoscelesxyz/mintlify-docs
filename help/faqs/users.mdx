## Tokens and Governance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is AERO and what role does it play in governance?" icon="coins">
    `AERO` is the utility token of Aerodrome. It is distributed each week through a process called "emissions" in which voters direct newly minted tokens to liquidity providers with staked deposits. Learn more about [emissions and tokenomics](/overview/tokenomics/emissions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is veAERO, and how do I lock tokens?" icon="lock">
    `veAERO` is the governance token of Aerodrome. It is created by locking `AERO` for up to four years. Holders of `veAERO` vote each week to distribute `AERO` to LPs. In exchange for this service, voters receive 100% of protocol revenue from the pools they vote for. See [How to Lock AERO](/guides/vote/lock-aero) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a gauge?" icon="gauge">
    A gauge functions like the clearing house for each liquidity pool that is eligible for emissions. `veAERO` holders cast votes which go into the gauge, new `AERO` emissions are sent to the gauge for distribution, and fees and incentives are also in the gauge before being sent to voters for that pool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do incentives work, and why do protocols use them?" icon="gift">
    Incentives are tokens deposited into liquidity pool gauges with the aim of attracting voters to direct emissions to the pool. They are integral to the bootstrapping mechanics of Aerodrome. For example: if a protocol wants liquidity providers to deposit tokens in a new pool before it has any swap fees, they can deposit an incentive. That incentive attracts voters (who claim the incentive if they vote for the pool). The more votes for the pool, the more `AERO` emissions are directed to it. Then liquidity providers deposit and stake liquidity in the pool to earn those emissions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidity and Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are trading fees distributed between LPs and veNFT holders?" icon="chart-pie">
    **Fee distribution summary:**

    - **Staked liquidity**: 100% of trading fees sent to voters
    - **Unstaked concentrated liquidity**: 10% of fees sent to voters; 90% to LPs
    - **Unstaked basic liquidity**: 100% of fees sent to LPs

    <Warning>
    If you stake your liquidity, you will only receive emissions and forfeit all trading fees.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I claim my rewards?" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    **To claim your rewards:**

    1. Go to your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dashboard) on Aerodrome
    2. Find your deposit and expand the details
    3. Click "Claim" to collect your rewards

    **Reward types:**

    - **Staked positions**: Receive `AERO` emissions
    - **Unstaked positions**: Receive trading fees in the pool's token pair
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does it mean to 'stake' my LP?" icon="layer-group">
    Staking your deposit means you will no longer receive swap fees as rewards and instead will receive `AERO` emissions. This is beneficial when the `AERO` emissions directed to the pool (based on votes) exceed the trading fees you would earn from unstaked liquidity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I not receiving emissions from my LP?" icon="circle-question">
    Only deposits that have been staked are eligible for emissions. If your deposit is staked and you still do not receive emissions, it could be because the pool received no votes or your CL position fell out of the active price range.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can I not redeem trading fees from my LP?" icon="circle-question">
    If you have an unstaked deposit, you will earn a portion of swap fees. To claim, go to your dashboard, expand the deposit list, and select "Claim".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pool Types and Trading

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between volatile and stable pools?" icon="water">
    Volatile pools are optimized for non-correlated assets (e.g. `AERO` and `BTC`). Stable pools are optimized for closely correlated assets (often different versions of the same asset, e.g. `WETH` and `ETH`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does CLAMM work?" icon="chart-line">
    Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity solution is called "Slipstream." LPs who deposit into a concentrated pool must select a price range where their liquidity will be active. They will then receive rewards only when the actively traded price is within that range. They can also choose to use "Autopilot," an automated liquidity management tool from Mellow.

    <Warning>
    CL pools require active management to stay in range. If your position falls outside the active price range, you will not earn rewards until the price returns to your range.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and Protocol

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are Aerodrome contracts audited? By whom?" icon="shield-check">
    Chain Security is our preferred security partner. We usually involve their team as early as possible in the conversations about architecture security, trust assumptions and more generic security operations.

    We've also worked and have a deep appreciation for teams like Spearbit and Sherlock.

    To learn about our audits, please refer to our dedicated [security page](https://aerodrome.finance/security).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is team compensation structured?" icon="wallet">
    The launch of Aerodrome included the creation of a wallet dedicated to funding ongoing development and operations support. That wallet received 19% of the initial supply of `AERO` (as locked `veAERO`) and also receives 5% of weekly emissions. The wallet uses this voting position each week to earn rewards. Those rewards are then used to compensate the development company. This method of compensation is crucial to maintaining a sustainable system because it aligns the interests of any contributor with the interests of all other stakeholders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## veNFT Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I transfer veNFT?" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    veNFTs are transferable like any other NFT. Simply send from your wallet to the address of your choice.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I sell my veNFT?" icon="tag">
    veNFTs can easily be traded on third-party platforms, often at a discount.

    <Tip>
    veNFTs can be traded on third-party NFT marketplaces, often at a discount reflecting the lock duration.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I sell my veNFT?" icon="user-group">
    The recipient of the veNFT inherits all rights and control over the voting position.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Coinbase's DEX integration tie into Aerodrome?" icon="building-columns">
    Coinbase integrated DEX trading in August, 2025. This means that Coinbase users can trade for assets on Aerodrome directly from the Coinbase UI. For Coinbase users, this means increased access to onchain assets. For liquidity providers, this means a new volume source. For protocols this means broader access to users. For `veAERO` holders, this means increased fees distributed as voting rewards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is 'the MetaDEX'?" icon="diagram-project">
    MetaDEX is the underlying model of Aerodrome. Think of it as an operating system for DEXs. The current version of the MetaDEX is METADEX02.
