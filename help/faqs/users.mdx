### **What is $AERO and what role does it play in governance?**

AERO is the utility token of Aerodrome. It is distributed each week through a process called "emissions" in which voters direct newly minted tokens to liquidity providers with staked deposits.

### **What is veAERO, and how do I lock tokens?**

veAERO is the governance token of Aerodrome. It is created by locking AERO for up to four years. Holders of veAERO vote each week to distribute AERO to LPs. In exchange for this service, voters receive 100% of protocol revenue from the pools they vote for.

### **How are trading fees distributed between LPs and veNFT holders?**

- 100% of trading fees from staked liquidity is sent to voters
- 10% of fees from unstaked concentrated liquidity is sent to voters
- 100% of fees generated by unstaked liquidity in basic pools go to liquidity providers
- 90% of fees from unstaked liquidity in concentrated pools go to liquidity providers

_Important: if an LP stakes their liquidity, they are opting to only receive emissions and will not receive fees._

### **What is a gauge?**

A gauge functions like the clearing house for each liquidity pool that is eligible for emissions. veAERO holders cast votes which go into the gauge, new AERO emissions are sent to the gauge for distribution, and fees and incentives are also in the gauge before being sent to voters for that pool.

### **How do incentives work, and why do protocols use them?**

Incentives are tokens deposited into liquidity pool gauges with the aim of attracting voters to direct emissions to the pool. They are integral to the bootstrapping mechanics of Aerodrome. For example: if a protocol wants liquidity providers to deposit tokens in a new pool before it has any swap fees, they can deposit an incentive. That incentive attracts voters (who claim the incentive if they vote for the pool). The more votes for the pool, the more AERO emissions are directed to it. Then liquidity providers deposit and stake liquidity in the pool to earn those emissions.

### **What's the difference between volatile and stable pools?**

Volatile pools are optimized for non-correlated assets (e.g. AERO and BTC). Stable pools are optimized for closely correlated assets (often different versions of the same asset, e.g. WETH and ETH).

### **Are Aerodrome contracts audited? By whom?**

Chain Security is our preferred security partner. We usually involve their team as early as possible in the conversations about architecture security, trust assumptions and more generic security operations.

We've also worked and have a deep appreciation for teams like Spearbit and Sherlock.

To learn about our audits, please refer to our dedicated [security page](https://aerodrome.finance/security).

### **How is team compensation structured?**

The launch of Aerodrome included the creation of a wallet dedicated to funding ongoing development and operations support. That wallet received 19% of the initial supply of AERO (as locked veAERO) and also receives 5% of weekly emissions. The wallet uses this voting position each week to earn rewards. Those rewards are then used to compensate the development company. This method of compensation is crucial to maintaining a sustainable system because it aligns the interests of any contributor with the interests of all other stakeholders.

### **How does Coinbase's DEX integration tie into Aerodrome?**

Coinbase integrated DEX trading in August, 2025. This means that Coinbase users can trade for assets on Aerodrome directly from the Coinbase UI. For Coinbase users, this means increased access to onchain assets. For liquidity providers, this means a new volume source. For protocols this means easy distribution to millions of users. For veAERO holders, this means increased fees distributed as voting rewards.

### **How do I claim my rewards?**

See "Rewards"

### **How do I transfer veNFT?**

veNFTs are transferable like any other NFT. Simply send from your wallet to the address of your choice.

### **How do I sell my veNFT?**

veNFTs can easily be traded on third-party platforms, often at a discount.

### **What happens if I sell my veNFT?**

The recipient of the veNFT inherits all rights and control over the voting position.

### **How does CLAMM work?**

Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity solution is called "Slipstream." LPs who deposit into a concentrated pool must select a price range where their liquidity will be active. They will then receive rewards only when the actively traded price is within that range. They can also choose to use "Autopilot," an automated liquidity management tool from Mellow.

### **Why am I not receiving emissions from my LP?**

Only deposits that have been staked are eligible for emissions. If your deposit is staked and you still do not receive emissions, it could be because the pool received no votes or your CL position fell out of the active price range.

### **Why can I not redeem trading fees from my LP?**

If you have an unstaked deposit, you will earn a portion of swap fees. To claim, go to your dashboard, expand the deposit list, and select "Claim"

### **What does it mean to "stake" my LP?**

Staking your deposit means you will no longer receive swap fees as rewards and instead will receive AERO emissions.

### **What is "the MetaDEX"?**

MetaDEX is the underlying model of Aerodrome. Think of it as an operating system for DEXs. The current version of the MetaDEX is METADEX02.
