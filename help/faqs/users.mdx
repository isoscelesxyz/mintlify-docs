## Feature-Specific Help

Each feature has its own comprehensive troubleshooting
section with step-by-step solutions. View the sidebar navigation for [Overview](/overview) for all features.

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I connect my wallet and select the correct network?">
    To use Aerodrome, you need a Web3 wallet configured for Base network:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install a compatible wallet">
        Popular options include:
        - [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) (recommended for beginners)
        - [Rabby](https://rabby.io/)
        - [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)
        - MetaMask, WalletConnect, or other Web3 wallets
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add Base network">
        Most modern wallets auto-detect Base. If not, add manually:
        - **Network Name**: Base
        - **Chain ID**: 8453
        - **RPC URL**: https://mainnet.base.org
        - **Currency Symbol**: ETH
        - **Block Explorer**: https://basescan.org
      </Step>

      <Step title="Connect to Aerodrome">
        1. Visit [aerodrome.finance](https://aerodrome.finance)
        2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
        3. Select your wallet provider
        4. Approve the connection request
        5. Verify you're on **Base network** (shown in wallet)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Switch networks if needed">
        If you're on the wrong network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet), your wallet will prompt you to switch. Click "Switch Network" to continue.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
    Aerodrome only works on Base network (chain ID: 8453). If you're on Ethereum mainnet or another network, you won't be able to interact with the protocol.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I get tokens on Base?">
    You need tokens on Base network to swap, provide liquidity, or vote on emissions.

    **Option 1: Bridge from Ethereum**
    - Use the official [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org) (recommended)
    - Or bridge through [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) for integrated experience
    - Bridge ETH, USDC, or other supported tokens from Ethereum to Base

    **Option 2: Buy directly on Base**
    - Use fiat on-ramp services that support Base
    - Purchase ETH or USDC directly on Base network
    - Coinbase users can buy and send directly to Base

    **Option 3: Receive from another wallet**
    - Ask sender to send tokens to your Base address
    - Your Ethereum address works on Base (same address, different network)
    - **Warning**: Always verify the sender is using Base network, not Ethereum

    **What tokens you'll need:**
    - **ETH**: Required for gas fees (even small amounts work)
    - **USDC/WETH**: Common for swapping and providing liquidity
    - **AERO**: If you want to vote on emissions and earn protocol revenue (can swap for it on Aerodrome)

    <Tip>
    Start with at least $20 worth of ETH for gas fees and some USDC or WETH to experiment with swapping and liquidity provision.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do approvals work and when are they needed?">
    **What are approvals?**

    Approvals (also called "token allowances") give smart contracts permission to move your tokens. They're required before you can:
    - Swap tokens
    - Add liquidity to pools
    - Stake LP tokens or CL positions
    - Lock AERO for veAERO

    **How approvals work:**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="First interaction">
        The first time you use a token with a specific contract (e.g., swapping USDC), you'll see an "Approve" button.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Approve transaction">
        Click "Approve" and confirm in your wallet. This transaction costs gas but doesn't move your tokens.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set allowance">
        The approval grants the contract permission to spend up to a specified amount (usually unlimited for convenience).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Proceed with action">
        After approval confirms, you can proceed with the actual transaction (swap, deposit, etc.).
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **When you need approvals:**
    - ✅ **Once per token per contract** - First time using a token in a specific action
    - ✅ **After revoking** - If you previously revoked approvals for security
    - ❌ **Not for receiving tokens** - Approvals only needed for spending
    - ❌ **Not for ETH/native tokens** - ETH doesn't require approvals

    **Approval tips:**
    - Most wallets default to "unlimited" approval (saves gas on future transactions)
    - You can set exact amounts if preferred (requires re-approval when exceeded)
    - Revoke unused approvals for security using tools like [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash)

    <Info>
    Approvals are separate from the actual transaction. You'll confirm two transactions: (1) the approval, then (2) the swap/deposit/stake action.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are epochs and why do they matter?">
    **Epochs** are 7-day periods that run from **Thursday 00:00 UTC** to **Wednesday 23:59 UTC**. All protocol activities align with this weekly schedule.

    **What happens each epoch:**

    | Event | Timing | Details |
    |-------|--------|---------|
    | **Voting deadline** | Wednesday 23:59 UTC | Last chance to vote or change votes |
    | **Epoch starts** | Thursday 00:00 UTC | New epoch begins |
    | **Emissions distributed** | Thursday 00:00 UTC | AERO tokens sent to staked LPs based on votes |
    | **Rewards accrue** | Throughout the week | Fees and emissions accumulate |
    | **Voting rewards claimable** | Next Thursday | Fees and incentives from previous epoch become claimable |

    **Why epochs matter to you:**

    **If you're a veAERO voter:**
    - Vote before Wednesday 23:59 UTC to direct next week's emissions
    - Votes carry over automatically (no need to vote every week)
    - Claim rewards (fees + incentives) after each epoch completes

    **If you're a liquidity provider:**
    - AERO emissions are distributed at epoch start (Thursday)
    - Emissions accrue continuously throughout the epoch
    - Claim emissions anytime during or after the epoch

    **If you're swapping:**
    - Epochs don't affect trading (swap anytime)
    - Pool liquidity may shift based on weekly vote changes

    **Key insight:**
    Epochs create a predictable rhythm for voting, emissions, and rewards. Understanding this schedule helps you time votes, claims, and liquidity decisions.

    <Tip>
    Most active participants vote near the Wednesday deadline after seeing final incentive amounts. This maximizes information before committing votes.
    </Tip>

## Tokens and Voting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is AERO and how is it used?">
    `AERO` is the utility token of Aerodrome. It is distributed each week through a process called "emissions" in which voters direct newly minted tokens to liquidity providers with staked deposits. Learn more about [emissions and tokenomics](/overview/tokenomics/overview).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is veAERO, and how do I lock tokens?">
  `veAERO` is the voting token of Aerodrome. It is created by locking `AERO` for up to four years.
  Holders of `veAERO` vote each week to distribute `AERO` to LPs. In exchange for this service,
  voters receive 100% of protocol revenue from the pools they vote for. See
  [Lock](/overview/core-features/lock) documentation for step-by-step instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a gauge?">
  A gauge functions like the clearing house for each liquidity pool that is eligible for emissions.
  `veAERO` holders cast votes which go into the gauge, new `AERO` emissions are sent to the gauge
  for distribution, and fees and incentives are also in the gauge before being sent to voters for
  that pool.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do incentives work, and why do protocols use them?">
    Incentives are tokens deposited into liquidity pool gauges with the aim of attracting voters to direct emissions to the pool. They are integral to the bootstrapping mechanics of Aerodrome. For example: if a protocol wants liquidity providers to deposit tokens in a new pool before it has any swap fees, they can deposit an incentive. That incentive attracts voters (who claim the incentive if they vote for the pool). The more votes for the pool, the more `AERO` emissions are directed to it. Then liquidity providers deposit and stake liquidity in the pool to earn those emissions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidity and Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are trading fees distributed between LPs and veNFT holders?">
    **Fee distribution summary:**

    - **Staked liquidity**: 100% of trading fees sent to voters
    - **Unstaked concentrated liquidity**: 10% of fees sent to voters; 90% to LPs
    - **Unstaked basic liquidity**: 100% of fees sent to LPs

    <Warning>
    If you stake your liquidity, you will only receive emissions and forfeit all trading fees.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I claim my rewards?">
    ### To claim your rewards

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to your [Dashboard](https://aerodrome.finance/dash) on Aerodrome</Step>
  <Step>Find your deposit and expand the details</Step>
  <Step>Click "Claim" to collect your rewards</Step>
</Steps>
### Reward types

    - **Staked positions**: Receive `AERO` emissions
    - **Unstaked positions**: Receive trading fees in the pool's token pair

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does it mean to 'stake' my LP?">
  Staking your deposit means you will no longer receive swap fees as rewards and instead will
  receive `AERO` emissions. This is beneficial when the `AERO` emissions directed to the pool (based
  on votes) exceed the trading fees you would earn from unstaked liquidity.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Pool Types and Trading

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between volatile and stable pools?">
    Volatile pools are optimized for non-correlated assets (e.g. `AERO` and `BTC`). Stable pools are optimized for closely correlated assets (often different versions of the same asset, e.g. `WETH` and `ETH`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does CLAMM work?">
    Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity solution is called "Slipstream." LPs who deposit into a concentrated pool must select a price range where their liquidity will be active. They will then receive rewards only when the actively traded price is within that range. They can also choose to use "Autopilot," an automated liquidity management tool from Mellow.

    <Warning>
    CL pools require active management to stay in range. If your position falls outside the active price range, you will not earn rewards until the price returns to your range.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Concentrated Liquidity (CL)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is concentrated liquidity and how does it work?">
    Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity solution is called "Slipstream." LPs deposit liquidity within specific price ranges for higher capital efficiency. You only earn rewards when the active price is within your selected range.

    **Key features:**
    - Choose your own price range (ticks)
    - Higher fees per dollar when in range
    - Requires active management
    - Can use Autopilot for automated rebalancing

    **→ [Complete CL Guide](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/concentrated-pools)**

    <Tip>
    The concentrated pools page includes detailed guidance on tick spacing, range selection, rebalancing strategies, and comprehensive troubleshooting for all CL operations.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I manage my CL position?">
    For detailed guidance on managing concentrated liquidity positions, including:
    - Choosing narrow vs wide ranges
    - What happens when price moves out of range
    - How to rebalance positions
    - Adding/removing liquidity from CL positions
    - When to stake vs unstake
    - Claiming CL fees

    **→ [See CL Position Management Guide](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/concentrated-pools#managing-cl-positions)**

    **→ [CL Troubleshooting](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/concentrated-pools#troubleshooting)**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use Autopilot for my CL position?">
    Autopilot is an automated liquidity management tool that handles rebalancing for you. Consider Autopilot if:
    - You don't want to manually rebalance positions
    - You can't actively monitor price movements
    - Gas costs for manual rebalancing are high relative to position size

    Autopilot is free to use with no management fees.

    **→ [Learn about Autopilot](/overview/core-features/liquidity-pools/autopilot)**

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and Protocol

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are Aerodrome contracts audited? By whom?">
    Chain Security is our preferred security partner. We usually involve their team as early as possible in the conversations about architecture security, trust assumptions and more generic security operations.

    We've also worked and have a deep appreciation for teams like Spearbit and Sherlock.

    To learn about our audits, please refer to our dedicated [security page](https://aerodrome.finance/security).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is team compensation structured?">
    The launch of Aerodrome included the creation of a wallet dedicated to funding ongoing development and operations support. That wallet received 19% of the initial supply of `AERO` (as locked `veAERO`) and also receives 5% of weekly emissions. The wallet uses this voting position each week to earn rewards. Those rewards are then used to compensate the development company. This method of compensation is crucial to maintaining a sustainable system because it aligns the interests of any contributor with the interests of all other stakeholders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## veNFT Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I transfer, sell, or manage my veNFT?">
    veNFTs are transferable like any other NFT and can be traded on third-party platforms.

    **Transfer options:**
    - Send to another wallet address
    - Sell on NFT marketplaces (often at a discount)
    - The recipient inherits all voting rights and rewards

    For all lock management operations including merging and permanent locks, see the [Lock guide](/overview/core-features/lock#managing-your-lock).

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Relay (Managed veNFTs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Relay and how does it work?">
    Relay is an automated veAERO management system that handles voting, lock extensions, and reward compounding for you.

    **Key points:**
    - Automatically extends your lock to 4 years
    - Manages weekly voting on your behalf
    - Auto-compounds rebases
    - Two strategy types: Compounders (maximize voting power) and Convertors (liquid yield)

    **→ [Complete Relay Guide](/overview/core-features/lock/relay)**

    **→ [Relay Troubleshooting](/overview/core-features/lock/relay#troubleshooting)**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who controls voting when I deposit into Relay?">
    The Relay manager controls your weekly gauge votes while your veAERO is deposited. You retain ownership of your position and can withdraw after the first epoch completes.

    **→ [Learn more about Relay](/overview/core-features/lock/relay)**

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Voting & Gauges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I split votes across multiple pools?">
    You can distribute your voting power across as many pools as you want:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Vote page">
        Go to the [Vote page](https://aerodrome.finance/vote) on Aerodrome.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Find pools to vote for">
        Search for or browse the pools you want to support. You can vote for 100+ pools at once.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Enter vote percentages">
        For each pool, enter a percentage of your voting power. The UI shows a running total as you allocate.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Ensure total equals 100%">
        Your vote percentages must total exactly 100%. The interface will prevent submission if they don't.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Submit votes">
        All votes are submitted in a single transaction. Confirm in your wallet.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Example allocation:**
    - 40% to AERO/USDC pool
    - 35% to WETH/USDC pool
    - 25% to wstETH/WETH pool

    <Tip>
    You can vote for as many pools as you want in a single transaction. There's no limit on the number of pools you can support.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my vote mid-epoch?">
    Yes, but with important caveats:

    **How to change votes:**
    1. You must **RESET all current votes** first (deletes your entire allocation)
    2. Then allocate new votes from zero
    3. New votes apply to the current epoch immediately

    **Important considerations:**
    - You **cannot incrementally adjust** votes - it's all-or-nothing
    - Each reset costs gas fees
    - Resetting and re-voting mid-epoch may affect your rewards

    **Best practice:**
    Vote once per epoch near the deadline (Wednesday before 23:59 UTC) after reviewing all incentives. This way you can see the final incentive amounts before committing your votes.

    <Warning>
    Changing votes mid-epoch requires resetting ALL votes, not just adjusting individual pools. Make sure the gas cost and potential reward changes justify the reset.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do votes carry over to the next epoch?">
    **Yes, votes carry over automatically** unless:
    - You manually reset your votes
    - Your veNFT lock expires (voting power becomes zero)
    - You transfer or sell your veNFT

    **Benefits of automatic carryover:**
    - "Set and forget" voting - no need to vote every week
    - Your votes remain active even if you don't visit the app
    - Reduces gas costs (only vote when you want to change allocation)

    **However:**
    The incentive landscape changes weekly. Active voters adjust their allocations to maximize returns based on current incentives and pool performance.

    <Tip>
    While votes carry over, consider reviewing your allocation weekly to capture the best opportunities as protocols adjust their incentives.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When is the vote deadline and when do rewards start?">
    **Weekly epoch timeline (all times UTC):**

    | Event | Day/Time | Details |
    |-------|----------|---------|
    | **Vote deadline** | Wednesday 23:59 UTC | Last chance to vote or change votes for upcoming epoch |
    | **New epoch starts** | Thursday 00:00 UTC | Emission distribution begins |
    | **Emissions begin** | Thursday 00:00 UTC | AERO distributed immediately to staked LPs |
    | **Rewards accrue** | Throughout epoch | Fees and emissions accumulate during the week |
    | **Fees/incentives claimable** | After epoch completes (next Thursday) | Voting rewards become claimable |

    **Timeline visual:**
    ```
    Wed 23:59 UTC → Vote deadline
    Thu 00:00 UTC → Epoch starts, emissions begin
    Thu-Wed      → Rewards accrue
    Next Thu     → Claim voting rewards (fees + incentives)
    ```

    <Tip>
    Vote near the Wednesday deadline to see final incentive amounts before committing your votes. Protocols often deposit incentives throughout the week.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I choose pools to maximize returns?">
    Choosing pools requires balancing multiple factors. Here are key considerations (not investment advice):

    **1. Check incentives:**
    - Look at $/vote ratio displayed on pool gauges
    - Higher $/vote = more rewards per unit of voting power
    - Compare across pools to find best opportunities

    **2. Evaluate trading fees:**
    - High-volume pools generate more fee revenue
    - Fees are distributed to voters along with incentives
    - Check 7-day and 30-day volume trends

    **3. Balance risk and reward:**
    - Established pools (WETH/USDC) = lower risk, stable returns
    - Emerging pools = higher potential returns, higher risk
    - New token pools = evaluate project fundamentals

    **4. Consider diversification:**
    - **Concentrated strategy**: Put all votes in 1-2 high-incentive pools
    - **Diversified strategy**: Spread votes across 5-10 pools to reduce risk
    - Both approaches have merit depending on your risk tolerance

    **5. Monitor weekly changes:**
    - Incentives change every epoch as protocols adjust their deposits
    - Pool popularity shifts based on market conditions
    - Active management can improve returns

    <Warning>
    Past performance does not guarantee future results. Always do your own research before voting. Pool incentives, volumes, and returns fluctuate weekly based on market conditions and protocol strategies.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Coinbase's DEX integration tie into Aerodrome?">
    Coinbase integrated DEX trading in August 2024. This means that Coinbase users can trade for assets on Aerodrome directly from the Coinbase UI. For Coinbase users, this means increased access to onchain assets. For liquidity providers, this means a new volume source. For protocols this means broader access to users. For `veAERO` holders, this means increased fees distributed as voting rewards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is 'the MetaDEX'?">
    MetaDEX is the underlying model of Aerodrome. Think of it as an operating system for DEXs. The current version of the MetaDEX is METADEX02.

    Learn more on the [Aerodrome blog](https://paragraph.com/@dromos).
