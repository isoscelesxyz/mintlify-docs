## Primary audience

Developers building applications or integrations that need to fetch Aerodrome protocol data programmatically. Sugar enables efficient data queries without multiple separate contract calls.

## What is Sugar?

Sugar is a smart contract that aggregates data from multiple protocol contracts into single, gas-efficient calls. Instead of making dozens of individual contract calls to fetch pool data, liquidity positions, or rewards, you can use Sugar to batch these queries.

**Key benefits:**

- **Gas efficient**: Single contract call instead of multiple queries
- **Comprehensive**: Returns structured data for pools, positions, rewards, and governance
- **On-chain**: No reliance on external indexers or APIs
- **Real-time**: Always reflects current blockchain state

## Contract addresses

**Coming soon**: Sugar contract addresses for Base network

For the latest contract addresses, verify from the [official contract addresses page](/overview/security/contract-addresses).

## Available endpoints

### Pool queries

**Coming soon**: Documentation for pool-related Sugar methods including:
- `all()` - Fetch all pools with pagination
- `byIndex()` - Fetch specific pool by index
- `/pools/top` - Highest TVL pools (Sugar v3)

### Position queries

**Coming soon**: Documentation for liquidity position methods

### Rewards queries

**Coming soon**: Documentation for rewards and bribes data methods

### Governance queries

**Coming soon**: Documentation for voting and epoch data methods including:
- `/epochs/latest` - Current epoch with voting deadlines (Sugar v3)

## Usage examples

**Coming soon**: Code examples for integrating Sugar API in TypeScript, Python, and other languages

### Basic pool query example

```typescript
// Example structure (verify ABI and method names from GitHub)
import { readContract } from 'viem'

const pools = await readContract({
  address: '0x...', // Sugar contract address
  abi: sugarAbi,
  functionName: 'all',
  args: [limit, offset]
})
```

## Version history

### Sugar v3 (January 2025)

Released with improved data endpoints:

- New `/pools/top` endpoint for highest TVL pools
- Enhanced `/epochs/latest` with voting deadline timestamps
- Performance improvements across all endpoints (avg 40% faster)
- Added WebSocket support for real-time pool updates

See the [changelog](/changelog/README) for complete version history.
