### Sugar Smart Contracts

Sugar is Aerodrome and Velodrome's onchain API contract that enables fully decentralized data access without relying on centralized indexers, databases, or backend infrastructure.

By aggregating protocol data directly onchain, Sugar allows frontends and applications to remain entirely in web3—avoiding the common pitfall of decentralized protocols depending on centralized data infrastructure. All protocol data is queryable through a smart contract calls, eliminating the need for traditional backend services.

### Sugar TypeScript SDK

[`@dromos-labs/sdk.js`](https://velodrome-finance.github.io/sdk.js/) is a library that simplifies integration with Aerodrome and Velodrome protocol contracts.

The SDK provides typed interfaces and helper functions for common operations like swaps, liquidity provision, staking, and data queries—making it easier to build applications on top of Aerodrome and Velodrome without dealing with raw contract interactions.

### Sugar Python SDK

[`velodrome-finance/sugar-sdk`](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/sugar-sdk) is a Python client for interacting with Sugar contracts.

It wraps Sugar on-chain queries and operations in Pythonic interfaces. It supports sync and async workflows, chain configuration, and helpers for swaps, cross-chain quotes, and structured protocol data access. Example use cases include fetching pool lists, price quotes, and executing swaps programmatically from Python.
