---

Sugar is Aerodrome's onchain API contract that enables fully decentralized data access without relying on centralized indexers, databases, or backend infrastructure.

By aggregating protocol data directly onchain, Sugar allows frontends and applications to remain entirely in web3—avoiding the common pitfall of decentralized protocols depending on centralized data infrastructure. All protocol data is queryable through a single contract call, eliminating the need for traditional backend services.
