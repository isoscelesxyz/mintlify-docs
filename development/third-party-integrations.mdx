description: "Developer guides for integrating Aerodrome into your application or protocol"
---

This guide is for **developers building applications, protocols, or services that need to interact with Aerodrome's smart contracts on Base**—including DeFi aggregators, portfolio managers, wallet integrations, and protocol-to-protocol integrations. You will learn how to integrate Aerodrome's swap and liquidity functionality into your application, including contract interaction patterns and best practices.

## Before you begin

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify contract addresses">
    Get verified contract addresses from the [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/contract-addresses) page. Never use addresses from unverified sources.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Base network access">
    Ensure your application can interact with Base network via RPC provider (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, or public Base RPC).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review security considerations">
    Read [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin) for smart contract risks and security best practices.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Smart contracts are immutable and transactions are irreversible. Test all integrations thoroughly on Base testnet before deploying to production.
</Warning>

## Integration overview

Aerodrome provides multiple integration points for developers:

- **[Sugar API](/development/sugar)**: Efficient on-chain data queries for pools, liquidity, rewards, and governance
- **Router contracts**: Execute swaps and manage liquidity positions
- **Pool contracts**: Direct interaction with volatile and stable AMM pools
- **UniversalRouter**: Slipstream (concentrated liquidity) operations

### Key contracts

- Router: See [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/contract-addresses)
- UniversalRouter (for Slipstream/CL pools)
- Sugar API for batch data queries

### Pool mathematics

Understanding pool formulas helps with price calculations:

- **Volatile pools**: Constant product formula `x * y = k`
- **Stable pools**: Curve formula `x³y + xy³ = k`

For detailed implementation examples and code snippets, see the [GitHub repositories](#github-resources) below.

## Best practices

### Security considerations

- **Verify contract addresses**: Always cross-reference with official sources
- **Test on testnet first**: Deploy and test integrations on Base Sepolia testnet
- **Set appropriate slippage**: Protect users from MEV and sandwich attacks
- **Handle reverts gracefully**: Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
- **Validate inputs**: Never trust user input without validation

### Gas optimization

- **Batch operations**: Combine multiple calls when possible
- **Use Sugar for queries**: More efficient than multiple individual contract calls
- **Optimize routing**: Find optimal swap paths to minimize hops

### User experience

- **Provide clear feedback**: Show users what will happen before they sign
- **Display price impact**: Warn users of high slippage or price impact
- **Include transaction deadlines**: Protect against stale transactions
- **Show expected outputs**: Calculate and display expected amounts

## GitHub resources

Explore the official Aerodrome contract repositories:

- **[Core Contracts](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts)**: V2 core contract implementations
- **[Slipstream](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream)**: Concentrated liquidity (V3) contracts
- **[Sugar API](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/sugar)**: On-chain data aggregation contract

Each repository includes:
- Full contract source code
- ABI definitions
- Deployment scripts
- Integration examples

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction reverts with 'Insufficient output amount'">
    This indicates slippage protection triggered. The actual output amount was lower than your specified minimum.

    **Solutions:**
    - Increase slippage tolerance (carefully - higher slippage = higher MEV risk)
    - Check pool liquidity depth before executing
    - Break large trades into smaller chunks
    - Wait for better market conditions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot find pool for token pair">
    The requested pool may not exist yet.

    **Solutions:**
    - Use Sugar API to query all available pools
    - Check if pool exists for the reverse pair (TOKEN1/TOKEN0 vs TOKEN0/TOKEN1)
    - Verify token addresses are correct
    - Consider multi-hop routing through intermediate tokens
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gas estimation fails">
    Transaction simulation is reverting, preventing gas estimation.

    **Solutions:**
    - Check token approvals are set correctly
    - Verify all input parameters (amounts, addresses, deadlines)
    - Ensure sufficient token balance
    - Test with a smaller amount first
    - Review error message for specific revert reason
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get contract ABIs?">
    ABIs are available from multiple sources:

    - **GitHub repositories**: Each contract repo includes ABI files
    - **Basescan**: View verified contract ABIs on [Basescan](https://basescan.org)
    - **Sugar repository**: Includes helper contract ABIs
