description: "Developer guides for integrating Aerodrome into your application or protocol"
---

You will learn how to integrate Aerodrome's swap and liquidity functionality into your application or protocol, including contract interaction patterns and best practices.

## Primary audience

Developers building applications, protocols, or services that need to interact with Aerodrome's smart contracts on Base. This includes DeFi aggregators, portfolio managers, wallet integrations, and protocol-to-protocol integrations.

## Before you begin

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify contract addresses">
    Get verified contract addresses from the [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/contract-addresses) page. Never use addresses from unverified sources.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Base network access">
    Ensure your application can interact with Base network via RPC provider (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, or public Base RPC).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review security considerations">
    Read [Before You Begin](/overview/getting-started/before-you-begin) for smart contract risks and security best practices.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Smart contracts are immutable and transactions are irreversible. Test all integrations thoroughly on Base testnet before deploying to production.
</Warning>

## Core integration patterns

### Querying pool data

Use the [Sugar API](/development/sugar) for efficient on-chain data queries:

**Coming soon**: Complete code examples for querying:
- Available pools and their reserves
- Current exchange rates and pricing
- Liquidity positions and rewards
- Voting and governance data

### Executing swaps

**Coming soon**: Integration guide for executing token swaps via Aerodrome Router contract, including:
- Building swap transactions
- Setting slippage tolerance
- Handling multi-hop routes
- Error handling and reverts

**Key contracts:**
- Router: See [Contract Addresses](/overview/security/contract-addresses)
- UniversalRouter (for Slipstream/CL pools)

### Adding and removing liquidity

**Coming soon**: Integration guide for liquidity operations, including:
- Depositing into Basic pools (volatile/stable)
- Depositing into Slipstream (concentrated liquidity) pools
- Withdrawing liquidity and claiming fees
- Position management

### Reading pool reserves and pricing

**Coming soon**: Examples for calculating prices and amounts from pool reserves

**Basic formula:**
- Volatile pools use constant product: `x * y = k`
- Stable pools use curve: `x³y + xy³ = k`

## Common integration use cases

### DeFi aggregators

**Coming soon**: Best practices for integrating Aerodrome into DEX aggregators and routing protocols

**Key considerations:**
- Quote comparison across multiple pools
- Gas optimization for routing
- Slippage protection

### Portfolio managers and vaults

**Coming soon**: Guidance for protocols managing liquidity positions on behalf of users

**Key considerations:**
- Automated position management
- Rebalancing strategies
- Fee claiming and compounding

### Analytics and dashboards

For data integrations, see:
- [Sugar API](/development/sugar) for on-chain queries
- [Data & Analytics](/development/data-analytics) for external data sources

## Code examples

**Coming soon**: Complete code examples in multiple languages:

### TypeScript (viem)

```typescript
// Coming soon: Example using viem for swap execution
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { base } from 'viem/chains'

// Example structure - verify exact ABI and addresses
const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http()
})

// Query pool data, execute swaps, etc.
```

### Python (web3.py)

```python
# Coming soon: Example using web3.py for Aerodrome integration
from web3 import Web3

# Connect to Base
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.base.org'))

# Query pools, execute swaps, etc.
```

### Solidity (Protocol-to-Protocol)

```solidity
// Coming soon: Example Solidity contract integrating Aerodrome
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IAerodromeRouter {
    // Interface definitions
}

contract YourProtocol {
    // Integration example
}
```

## Best practices

### Security considerations

- **Verify contract addresses**: Always cross-reference with official sources
- **Test on testnet first**: Deploy and test integrations on Base Sepolia testnet
- **Set appropriate slippage**: Protect users from MEV and sandwich attacks
- **Handle reverts gracefully**: Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
- **Validate inputs**: Never trust user input without validation

### Gas optimization

- **Batch operations**: Combine multiple calls when possible
- **Use Sugar for queries**: More efficient than multiple individual contract calls
- **Optimize routing**: Find optimal swap paths to minimize hops

### User experience

- **Provide clear feedback**: Show users what will happen before they sign
- **Display price impact**: Warn users of high slippage or price impact
- **Include transaction deadlines**: Protect against stale transactions
- **Show expected outputs**: Calculate and display expected amounts

## GitHub resources

Explore the official Aerodrome contract repositories:

- **[Core Contracts](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts)**: V2 core contract implementations
- **[Slipstream](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream)**: Concentrated liquidity (V3) contracts
- **[Sugar API](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/sugar)**: On-chain data aggregation contract

Each repository includes:
- Full contract source code
- ABI definitions
- Deployment scripts
- Integration examples

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction reverts with 'Insufficient output amount'">
    This indicates slippage protection triggered. The actual output amount was lower than your specified minimum.

    **Solutions:**
    - Increase slippage tolerance (carefully - higher slippage = higher MEV risk)
    - Check pool liquidity depth before executing
    - Break large trades into smaller chunks
    - Wait for better market conditions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot find pool for token pair">
    The requested pool may not exist yet.

    **Solutions:**
    - Use Sugar API to query all available pools
    - Check if pool exists for the reverse pair (TOKEN1/TOKEN0 vs TOKEN0/TOKEN1)
    - Verify token addresses are correct
    - Consider multi-hop routing through intermediate tokens
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gas estimation fails">
    Transaction simulation is reverting, preventing gas estimation.

    **Solutions:**
    - Check token approvals are set correctly
    - Verify all input parameters (amounts, addresses, deadlines)
    - Ensure sufficient token balance
    - Test with a smaller amount first
    - Review error message for specific revert reason
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get contract ABIs?">
    ABIs are available from multiple sources:

    - **GitHub repositories**: Each contract repo includes ABI files
    - **Basescan**: View verified contract ABIs on [Basescan](https://basescan.org)
    - **Sugar repository**: Includes helper contract ABIs
  </Accordion>
