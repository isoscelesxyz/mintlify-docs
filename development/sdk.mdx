The Aerodrome JavaScript SDK (`@dromos-labs/sdk.js`) is a TypeScript library that simplifies integration with Aerodrome protocol contracts on Base.

The SDK provides typed interfaces and helper functions for common operations like swaps, liquidity provision, staking, and data queries—making it easier to build applications on top of Aerodrome without dealing with raw contract interactions.
